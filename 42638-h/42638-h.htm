<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page629" id="page629"></a>629</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">MAP<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span>, a representation, on a plane and a reduced scale, of
part or the whole of the earth&rsquo;s surface. If specially designed
to meet the requirements of seamen it is called a chart, if on an
exceptionally large scale a plan. The words map and chart are
derived from <i>mappa</i> and <i>charta</i>, the former being the Latin for
napkin or cloth, the latter for papyrus or parchment. Maps
were thus named after the material upon which they were drawn
or painted, and it should be noted that even at present maps
intended for use in the open air, by cyclists, military men and
others, are frequently printed on cloth. In Italian, Spanish and
Portuguese the word <i>mappa</i> has retained its place, by the side
of <i>carta</i>, for marine charts, but in other languages both kinds
of maps<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> are generally known by a word derived from the Latin
<i>charta</i>, as <i>carte</i> in French, <i>Karte</i> in German, <i>Kaart</i> in Dutch.
A chart, in French, is called <i>carte hydrographique, marine or des
côtes</i>; in Spanish or Portuguese <i>carta de marear</i>, in Italian <i>carta
da navigare</i>, in German <i>Seekarte</i> (to distinguish it from <i>Landkarte</i>),
in Dutch <i>Zeekaart</i> or <i>Paskaart</i>. A chart on Mercator&rsquo;s projection
is called <i>Wassende graadkaart</i> in Dutch, <i>carte réduite</i> in
French. Lastly, a collection of maps is called an atlas, after
the figure of Atlas, the Titan, supporting the heavens, which
ornamented the title of Lafreri&rsquo;s and Mercator&rsquo;s atlases in the
16th century.</p>

<p><i>Classification of Maps.</i>&mdash;Maps differ greatly, not only as to
the scale on which they are drawn, but also with respect to the
fullness or the character of the information which they convey.
Broadly speaking, they may be divided into two classes, of
which the first includes topographical, chorographical and general
maps, the second the great variety designed for special purposes.</p>

<p>Topographical maps and plans are drawn on a scale sufficiently
large to enable the draughtsman to show most objects on a scale
true to nature.<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Its information should not only be accurate,
but also conveyed intelligibly and with taste. Exaggeration,
however, is not always to be avoided, for even on the British
1 in. ordnance map the roads appear as if they were 130 ft.
in width.</p>

<p>Chorographical (Gr. <span class="grk" title="chôra">&#967;&#974;&#961;&#945;</span>, country or region) and general
maps are either reduced from topographical maps or compiled
from such miscellaneous sources as are available. In the former
case the cartographer is merely called upon to reduce and generalize
the information given by his originals, to make a judicious
selection of place names, and to take care that the map is not
overcrowded with names and details. Far more difficult is
his task where no surveys are available, and the map has to
be compiled from a variety of sources. These materials
generally include reconnaissance survey of small districts, route
surveys and astronomical observations supplied by travellers,
and information obtained from native sources. The compiler,
in combining these materials, is called upon to examine the
various sources of information, and to form an estimate of their
value, which he can only do if he have himself some knowledge
of surveying and of the methods of determining positions by
astronomical observation. A knowledge of the languages in
which the accounts of travellers are written, and even of native
languages, is almost indispensable. He ought not to be satisfied
with compiling his map from existing maps, but should subject
each explorer&rsquo;s account to an independent examination, when he
will frequently find that either the explorer himself, or the
draughtsman employed by him, has failed to introduce into
his map the whole of the information available. Latitudes from
the observations of travellers may generally be trusted, but
longitudes should be accepted with caution; for so competent
an observer as Captain Speke placed the capital of Uganda in
longitude 32° 44&prime; E., when its true longitude as determined by
more trustworthy observations is 32° 26&prime; E., an error of 18&prime;.
Again, on the map illustrating Livingstone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Journals&rdquo;
the Luapula is shown as issuing from the Bangweulu in the
north-west, when an examination of the account of the natives
who carried the great explorer&rsquo;s remains to the coast would
have shown that it leaves that lake on the south.</p>

<p>The second group includes all maps compiled for special
purposes. Their variety is considerable, for they are designed
to illustrate physical and political geography, travel and navigation,
trade and commerce, and, in fact, every subject connected
with geographical distribution and capable of being illustrated
by means of a map. We thus have (1) physical maps in great
variety, including geological, orographical and hydrographical
maps, maps illustrative of the geographical distribution of
meteorological phenomena, of plants and animals, such as are
to be found in Berghaus&rsquo;s &ldquo;Physical Atlas,&rdquo; of which an enlarged
English edition is published by J. G. Bartholomew of Edinburgh;
(2) political maps, showing political boundaries; (3) ethnological
maps, illustrating the distribution of the varieties of man, the
density of population, &amp;c.; (4) travel maps, showing roads or
railways and ocean-routes (as is done by Philips&rsquo; &ldquo;Marine
Atlas&rdquo;), or designed for the special use of cyclists or aviators;
(5) statistical maps, illustrating commerce and industries; (6)
historical maps; (7) maps specially designed for educational
purposes.</p>

<p><i>Scale of Maps.</i>&mdash;Formerly map makers contented themselves
with placing upon their maps a linear scale of miles, deduced
from the central meridian or the equator. They now add the
proportion which these units of length have to nature, or state
how many of these units are contained within some local measure
of length. The former method, usually called the &ldquo;natural
scale,&rdquo; may be described as &ldquo;international,&rdquo; for it is quite
independent of local measures of length, and depends exclusively
upon the size and figure of the earth. Thus a scale of
1 : 1,000,000 signifies that each unit of length on the map
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page630" id="page630"></a>630</span>
represents one million of such units in nature. The second
method is still employed in many cases, and we find thus:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">1 in. = 1 statute mile (of 63,366 in.)</td> <td class="tcc">corresponds to</td> <td class="tcl">1 :  63,366</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tcl">1 cm. = 500 metres (of 100 cm.)</td> <td class="tcc">&rdquo;</td> <td class="tcl">1 :  50,000</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In cases where the draughtsman has omitted to indicate the
scale we can ascertain it by dividing the actual length of a meridian
degree by the length of a degree measure upon the map.
Thus a degree between 50° and 51° measures 111,226,000 mm.;
on the map it is represented by 111 mm. Hence the scale is
1 : 1,000,000 approximately.</p>

<p>The linear scale of maps can obviously be used only in the
case of maps covering a small area, for in the case of maps of
greater extension measurements would be vitiated owing to
the distortion or exaggeration inherent in all projections, not
to mention the expansion or shrinking of the paper in the process
of printing. As an extreme instance of the misleading character
of the scale given on maps embracing a wide area we may refer
to a map of a hemisphere. The scale of that map, as determined
by the equator or centre meridian, we will suppose to be
1 : 125,000,000, while the encircling meridian indicates a scale
of 1 : 80,000,000; and a &ldquo;mean&rdquo; scale, equal to the square root
of the proportion which the area of the map bears to the actual
area of a hemisphere, is 1 : 112,000,000. In adopting a scale
for their maps, cartographers will do well to choose a multiple
of 1000 if possible, for such a scale can claim to be
international, while in planning an atlas they ought to avoid
a needless multiplicity of scales.</p>

<p><i>Map Projections</i> are dealt with separately below. It will
suffice therefore to point out that the ordinary needs of the
cartographer can be met by conical projections, and, in the case
of maps covering a wide area, by Lambert&rsquo;s equal area projection.
The indiscriminate use of Mercator&rsquo;s projection, for maps of the
world, is to be deprecated owing to the inordinate exaggeration
of areas in high latitudes. In the case of topographical maps
sheets bounded by meridians and parallels are to be commended.</p>

<p>The meridian of Greenwich has been universally accepted as
the initial meridian, but in the case of most topographical
maps of foreign countries local meridians are still adhered to&mdash;the
more important among which are:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>outline</i> includes coast-line, rivers, roads, towns, and in
fact all objects capable of being shown on a map, with the
exception of the hills and of woods, swamps, deserts and the
like, which the draughtsman generally describes as &ldquo;ornament.&rdquo;
Conventional signs and symbols are universally used in depicting
these objects.</p>

<p><i>Delineation of the Ground.</i>&mdash;The mole-hills and serrated ridges
of medieval maps were still in almost general use at the close of
the 18th century, and are occasionally met with at the present
day, being cheaply produced, readily understood by the unlearned,
and in reality preferable to the uncouth and misleading
hatchings still to be seen on many maps. Far superior are
those scenographic representations which enable a person consulting
the map to identify prominent landmarks, such as the
Pic du Midi, which rises like a pillar to the south of Pau, but is
not readily discovered upon an ordinary map. This advantage
is still fully recognized, for such views of distant hills are still
commonly given on the margin of marine charts for the assistance
of navigators; military surveyors are encouraged to introduce
sketches of prominent landmarks upon their reconnaissance
plans, and the general public is enabled to consult &ldquo;Picturesque
Relief Maps&rdquo;&mdash;such as F. W. Delkeskamp&rsquo;s <i>Switzerland</i> (1830)
or his <i>Panorama of the Rhine</i>. Delineations such as these do not,
however, satisfy scientific requirements. All objects on a map
are required to be shown as projected horizontally upon a plane.
This principle must naturally be adhered to when delineating
the features of the ground. This was recognized by J. Picard
and other members of the Academy of Science whom Colbert, in
1668, directed to prepare a new map of France, for on David
Vivier&rsquo;s map of the environs of Paris (1674, scale 1 : 86,400)
very crude hachures bounding the rivers have been substituted
for the scenographic hills
of older maps. Little progress
in the delineation of
the ground, however, was
made until towards the
close of the 18th century,
when horizontal contours
and hachures regulated
according to the angle of
inclination of all slopes,
were adopted. These
contours intersect the
ground at a given distance
above or below the
level of the sea, and thus
bound a series of horizontal
planes (see fig. 1).
Contours of this kind
were first utilized by
M. S. Cruquius in his
chart of the Merwede
(1728); Philip Buache
(1737) introduced such
contours or isobaths (Gr.
<span class="grk" title="isos">&#7990;&#963;&#959;&#962;</span>, equal; <span class="grk" title="bathys">&#946;&#945;&#952;&#973;&#962;</span>, deep)
upon his chart of the
Channel, and intended to introduce similar contours or isohypses
(<span class="grk" title="hypsos">&#8020;&#968;&#959;&#962;</span>, height) for a representation of the land.
Dupain-Triel, acting upon a suggestion of his friend M. Ducarla,
published his <i>La France considérée dans les différentes hauteurs
de ses plaines</i> (1791), upon which equidistant contours at
intervals of 16 toises found a place. The scientific value of
these contoured maps is fully recognized. They not only
indicate the height of the land, but also enable us to compute
the declivity of the mountain slopes; and if minor features of
ground lying between two contours&mdash;such as ravines, as also
rocky precipices and glaciers&mdash;are indicated, as is done on the
Siegfried atlas of Switzerland, they fully meet the requirements
of the scientific man, the engineer and the mountain-climber.
At the same time it cannot be denied that these maps, unless the
contours are inserted at short intervals, lack graphic expression.
Two methods are employed to attain this: the first distinguishes
the strata or layers by colours; the second indicates the varying
slopes by shades or hachures. The first of these methods yields
a hypsographical, or&mdash;if the sea-bottom be included, in which
case all contours are referred to a common datum line&mdash;a bathy
hypsographical map. Carl Ritter, in 1806, employed graduated
tints, increasing in lightness on proceeding from the lowlands
to the highlands; while General F. von Hauslab, director of the
Austrian Surveys, in 1842, advised that the darkest tints should
be allotted to the highlands, so that they might not obscure
details in the densely peopled plains. The desired effect may
be produced by a graduation of the same colour, or by a polychromatic
scale&mdash;such as white, pale red, pale brown, various
shades of green, violet and purple, in ascending order. C. von
Sonklar, in his map of the Hohe Tauern (1 : 144,000; 1864)
coloured plains and valleys green; mountain slopes in five shades
of brown; glaciers blue or white. E. G. Ravenstein&rsquo;s map of
Ben Nevis (1887) first employed the colours of the spectrum,
viz. green to brown, in ascending order for the land; blue, indigo
and violet for the sea, increasing in intensity with the height
or the depth. At first cartographers chose their colours rather
arbitrarily. Thus Horsell, who was the first to introduce tints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page631" id="page631"></a>631</span>
on his map of Sweden and Norway (1 : 600,000; 1835), coloured
the lowlands up to 300 ft. in green, succeeded by red, yellow and
white for the higher ground; while A. Papen, on his hypsographical
map of Central Europe (1857) introduced a perplexing
range of colours. At the present time compilers of strata maps
generally limit themselves to two or three colours, in various
shades, with green for the lowlands, brown for the hills and blue
for the sea. On the international map of the world, planned by
Professor A. Penck on a scale of 1 : 1,000,000, which has been
undertaken by the leading governments of the world, the ground
is shown by contours at intervals of 100 metres (to be increased
to 200 and 500 metres in mountainous districts); the strata
are in graded tints, viz. blue for the sea, green for lowlands up
to 300 metres, yellow between 300 and 500 metres, brown up to
2000 metres, and reddish tints beyond that height.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2.</td></tr></table>

<p>The declivities of the ground are still indicated in most
topographical maps by a system of strokes or hachures, first
devised by L. Chr. Müller (<i>Plan und Kartenzeichnen</i>, 1788) and
J. G. Lehmann, who directed a survey of Saxony, 1780-1806,
and published his <i>Theorie der Bergzeichnung</i> in 1799. By this
method the slopes are indicated by strokes or hachures crossing
the contour lines at right angles, in the direction of flowing water,
and varying in thickness according to the degree of declivity
they represent (cf. for example, the map of <span class="sc">Switzerland</span> in
this work). The light is supposed to descend vertically upon
the country represented, and in a true scale of shade the intensity
increases with the inclination from 0° to 90°; but as such a scale
does not sufficiently differentiate the lesser inclinations which
are the most important, the author adopted a conventional
scale, representing a slope of 45° or more, supposed to be inaccessible,
as absolutely black, the level surfaces, which reflect all the
light which falls upon them, as perfectly white, and the intervening
slopes by a proportion between black and white, as in
fig. 2. The main principles of this system have been maintained,
but its details have been modified frequently to suit special
cases. Thus the French survey commission of 1828 fixed the
proportion of black to white at one and a half times the angle of
slope; while in Austria, where steep mountains constitute an
important feature, solid black has been reserved for a slope of
80°, the proportion of black to white varying from 80 : 0 (for
50°) to 8 : 72 (for 5°). On the map of Germany (1 : 100,000)
a slope of 50° is shown in solid black while stippled hachures are
used for gentle slopes up to 10°. Instead of shading lines
following the greatest slopes, lines following the contours and
varying in their thickness and in their intervals apart, according
to the slope of the ground to be represented, may be employed.
This method affords a ready and expeditious means of sketching
the ground, if the draughtsman limits himself to characteristically
indicating its features by what have been called &ldquo;form
lines.&rdquo; This method can be recommended in the case of plotting
the results of an explorer&rsquo;s route, or in the case of countries
of which we have no regular survey (cf. the map of <span class="sc">Afghanistan</span>
in this work).</p>

<p>Instead of supposing the light to fall vertically upon the
surface it is often supposed to fall obliquely, generally at an
angle of 45° from the upper left-hand corner. It is claimed for
this method that it affords a means of giving a graphic representation
of Alpine districts where other methods of shading
fail. The Dufour map of Switzerland (1 : 100,000) is one of the
finest examples of this style of hill-shading. For use in the field,
however, and for scientific work, a contoured map like Siegfried&rsquo;s
atlas of Switzerland, or, in the case of hilly country, a map
shaded on the assumption of a vertical light, will prove more
useful than one of these, notwithstanding that truth to nature
and artistic beauty are claimed on their behalf.</p>

<p>Instead of shading by lines, a like effect may be produced by
mezzotint shading (cf. the map of <span class="sc">Italy</span>, or other maps, in this
work, on a similar method), and if this be combined with contour
lines very satisfactory results can be achieved. If this tint be
printed in grey or brown, isohypses, in black or red, show
distinctly above it. The same combination is possible if hills
engraved in the ordinary manner are printed in colours, as is
done in an edition of the 1-inch ordnance map, with contours
in red and hills hachured in brown.</p>

<p>Efforts have been made of late years to improve the available
methods of representing ground, especially in Switzerland, but
the so-called stereoscopic or relief maps produced by F. Becker,
X. Imfeld, Kümmerly, F. Leuzinger and other able cartographers,
however admirable as works of art, do not, from the point of
utility, supersede the combination of horizontal contours with
shaded slopes, such as have been long in use. There seems to be
even less chance for the combination of coloured strata and
hachures proposed by K. Peucker, whose theoretical disquisitions
on aerial perspective are of interest, but have not hitherto led to
satisfactory practical results.<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>The above remarks apply more particularly to topographic
maps. In the case of general maps on a smaller scale, the
orographic features must be generalized by a skilful draughtsman
and artist. One of the best modern examples of this kind is
Vogel&rsquo;s map of Germany, on a scale of 1 : 500,000.</p>

<p><i>Selection of Names and Orthography.</i>&mdash;The nomenclature or
&ldquo;lettering&rdquo; of maps is a subject deserving special attention.
Not only should the names be carefully selected with special
reference to the objects which the map is intended to serve, and
to prevent overcrowding by the introduction of names which
can serve no useful object, but they should also be arranged in
such a manner as to be read easily by a person consulting the
map. It is an accepted rule now that the spelling of names in
countries using the Roman alphabet should be retained, with
such exceptions as have been familiarized by long usage. In
such cases, however, the correct native form should be added
within brackets, as Florence (Firenze), Leghorn (Livorno),
Cologne (Cöln) and so on. At the same time these corrupted
forms should be eliminated as far as possible. Names in
languages not using the Roman alphabet, or having no written
alphabet should be spelt phonetically, as pronounced on the spot.
An elaborate universal alphabet, abounding in diacritical marks,
has been devised for the purpose by Professor Lepsius, and various
other systems have been adopted for Oriental languages, and by
certain missionary societies, adapted to the languages in which
they teach. The following simple rules, laid down by a
Committee of the Royal Geographical Society, will be found
sufficient as a rule; according to this system the vowels are to be
sounded as in Italian, the consonants as in English, and no
redundant letters are to be introduced. The diphthong <i>ai</i> is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page632" id="page632"></a>632</span>
to be pronounced as in <i>aisle</i>; <i>au</i> as <i>ow</i> in <i>how</i>; <i>aw</i> as in <i>law</i>. <i>Ch</i>
is always to be sounded as in <i>church</i>, <i>g</i> is always hard; <i>y</i> always
represents a consonant; whilst <i>kh</i> and <i>gh</i> stand for gutturals.
One accent only is to be used, the acute, to denote the syllable
on which stress is laid. This system has in great measure been
followed throughout the present work, but it is obvious that in
numerous instances these rules must prove inadequate. The
introduction of additional diacritical marks, such as &#x2c9; and &#x2dc;,
used to express quantity, and the diaeresis, as in <i>aï</i>, to express
consecutive vowels, which are to be pronounced separately,
may prove of service, as also such letters as <i>ä</i>, <i>ö</i> and <i>ü</i>, to be
pronounced as in German, and in lieu of the French <i>ai</i>, <i>eu</i> or <i>u</i>.</p>

<p>The United States Geographic Board acts upon rules
practically identical with those indicated, and compiles
official lists of place-names, the use of which is binding upon
government departments, but which it would hardly be wise to
follow universally in the case of names of places outside America.</p>

<p class="pt2 center"><span class="sc">Measurement on Maps</span></p>

<p><i>Measurement of Distance.</i>&mdash;The shortest distance between two
places on the surface of a globe is represented by the arc of a great
circle. If the two places are upon the same meridian or upon the
equator the exact distance separating them is to be found by
reference to a table giving the lengths of arcs of a meridian and
of the equator. In all other cases recourse must be had to a map,
a globe or mathematical formula. Measurements made on a
topographical map yield the most satisfactory results. Even a
general map may be trusted, as long as we keep within ten
degrees of its centre. In the case of more considerable distances,
however, a globe of suitable size should be consulted, or&mdash;and this
seems preferable&mdash;they should be calculated by the rules of
spherical trigonometry. The problem then resolves itself in the
solution of a spherical triangle.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the formulae which follow we suppose l and l&prime; to represent the
latitudes, a and b the co-latitudes (90 &minus; l or 90° &minus; l&prime;), and t the
difference in longitude between them or the meridian distance,
whilst D is the distance required.</p>

<p>If both places have the same latitude we have to deal with an
isosceles triangle, of which two sides and the included angle are
given. This triangle, for the convenience of calculation, we divide
into two right-angled triangles. Then we have sin <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> D = sin a sin <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> t,
and since sin a = sin (90° &minus; l) = cos t, it follows that</p>

<p class="center">sin <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> D = cos l sin <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> t.</p>

<p>If the latitudes differ, we have to solve an oblique-angled spherical
triangle, of which two sides and the included angle are given. Thus,</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td rowspan="2">cos t =</td> <td>cos D &minus; cos a cos b</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="denom">sin a sin b</td></tr></table>

<p class="center">cos D = cos a cos b + sin a sin b cos t<br />

&emsp;&emsp; = sin l sin l&prime; + cos l cos l&prime; cos t.</p>

<p>In order to adapt this formula to logarithms, we introduce a
subsidiary angle p, such that cot p = cot l cos t; we then have</p>

<p class="center">cos D = sin l cos (l&prime; &minus; p) / sin p.</p>

<p>In the above formulae our earth is assumed to be a sphere, but
when calculating and reducing to the sea-level, a base-line, or the
side of a primary triangulation, account must be taken of the
spheroidal shape of the earth and of the elevation above the sea-level.
The error due to the neglect of the former would at most
amount to 1%, while a reduction to the mean level of the sea
necessitates but a trifling reduction, amounting, in the case of a
base-line 100,000 metres in length, measured on a plateau of 3700
metres (12,000 ft.) in height, to 57 metres only.</p>

<p>These orthodromic distances are of course shorter than those
measured along a loxodromic line, which intersects all parallels
at the same angle. Thus the distance between New York and
Oporto, following the former (great circle sailing), amounts to
3000 m., while following the rhumb, as in Mercator sailing, it
would amount to 3120 m.</p>

<p>These direct distances may of course differ widely with the
distance which it is necessary to travel between two places along
a road, down a winding river or a sinuous coast-line. Thus, the
direct distance, as the crow flies, between Brig and the hospice
of the Simplon amounts to 4.42 geogr. m. (slope nearly 9°),
while the distance by road measures 13.85 geogr. m. (slope nearly 3°).
Distances such as these can be measured only on a topographical
map of a fairly large scale, for on general maps many of
the details needed for that purpose can no longer be represented.
Space runners for facilitating these measurements, variously known
as chartometers, curvimeters, opisometers, &amp;c., have been devised
in great variety. Nearly all these instruments register the revolution
of a small wheel of known circumference, which is run along the
line to be measured.</p>

<p><i>The Measurement of Areas</i> is easily effected if the map at our
disposal is drawn on an equal area projection. In that case we
need simply cover the map with a network of squares&mdash;the area of
each of which has been determined with reference to the scale of
the map&mdash;count the squares, and estimate the contents of those
only partially enclosed within the boundary, and the result will
give the area desired. Instead of drawing these squares upon the
map itself, they may be engraved or etched upon glass, or drawn
upon transparent celluloid or tracing-paper. Still more expeditious
is the use of a planimeter, such as Captain Prytz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hatchet
Planimeter,&rdquo; which yields fairly accurate results, or G. Coradi&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Polar Planimeter,&rdquo; one of the most trustworthy instruments of
the kind.<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>When dealing with maps not drawn on an equal area projection
we substitute quadrilaterals bounded by meridians and parallels,
the areas for which are given in the &ldquo;Smithsonian Geographical
Tables&rdquo; (1894), in Professor H. Wagner&rsquo;s tables in the geographical
<i>Jahrbuch</i>, or similar works.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the area of a group of mountains projected on
a horizontal plane, such as is presented by a map, must differ widely
from the area of the superficies or physical surface of those mountains
exposed to the air. Thus, a slope of 45° having a surface of 100 sq. m.
projected upon a horizontal plane only measures 59 sq. m., whilst
100 sq. m. of the snowclad Sentis in Appenzell are reduced to 10 sq. m.
A hypsographical map affords the readiest solution of this question.
Given the area A of the plane between the two horizontal contours,
the height h of the upper above the lower contour, the length of
the upper contour l, and the area of the face presented by the
edge of the upper stratum t·h = A<span class="su">1</span>, the slope &alpha; is found to be tan
&alpha; = h·l / (A &minus; A<span class="su">1</span>); hence its superficies, A = A<span class="su">2</span> sec &alpha;. The result
is an approximation, for inequalities of the ground bounded by the
two contours have not been considered.</p>

<p>The hypsographical map facilitates likewise the determination
of the <i>mean height</i> of a country, and this height, combined with the
area, the determination of volume, or cubic contents, is a simple
matter.<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>
</div>

<p><i>Relief Maps</i> are intended to present a representation of the
ground which shall be absolutely true to nature. The object,
however, can be fully attained only if the scale of the map is
sufficiently large, if the horizontal and vertical scales are identical,
so that there shall be no exaggeration of the heights, and if
regard is had, eventually, to the curvature of the earth&rsquo;s surface.
Relief maps on a small scale necessitate a generalization of the
features of the ground, as in the case of ordinary maps, as likewise
an exaggeration of the heights. Thus on a relief on a scale
of 1 : 1,000,000 a mountain like Ben Nevis would only rise to a
height of 1.3 mm.</p>

<p>The methods of producing reliefs vary according to the scale
and the materials available. A simple plan is as follows&mdash;draw
an outline of the country of which a map is to be produced upon
a board; mark all points the altitude of which is known or can
be estimated by pins or wires clipped off so as to denote the
heights; mark river-courses and suitable profiles by strips of
vellum and finally finish your model with the aid of a good map,
in clay or wax. If contoured maps are available it is easy to
build up a strata-relief, which facilitates the completion of the
relief so that it shall be a fair representation of nature, which the
strata-relief cannot claim to be. A pantograph armed with
cutting-files<a name="fa6a" id="fa6a" href="#ft6a"><span class="sp">6</span></a> which carve the relief out of a block of gypsum, was
employed in 1893-1900 by C. Perron of Geneva, in producing his
relief map of Switzerland on a scale of 1 : 100,000. After copies
of such reliefs have been taken in gypsum, cement, statuary
pasteboard, fossil dust mixed with vegetable oil, or some other
suitable material, they are painted. If a number of copies is
required it may be advisable to print a map of the country
represented in colours, and either to emboss this map, backed
with papier-mâché, or paste it upon a copy of the relief&mdash;a task
of some difficulty. Relief maps are frequently objected to on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page633" id="page633"></a>633</span>
account of their cost, bulk and weight, but their great use in
teaching geography is undeniable.</p>

<p><i>Globes.</i><a name="fa7a" id="fa7a" href="#ft7a"><span class="sp">7</span></a>&mdash;It is impossible to represent on a plane the whole of
the earth&rsquo;s surface, or even a large extent of it, without a considerable
amount of distortion. On the other hand a map drawn
on the surface of a sphere representing a terrestrial globe will
prove true to nature, for it possesses, in combination, the
qualities which the ingenuity of no mathematician has hitherto
succeeded in imparting to a projection intended for a map of
some extent, namely, equivalence of areas of distances and angles.
Nevertheless, it should be observed that our globes take no
account of the oblateness of our sphere; but as the difference in
length between the circumference of the equator and the
perimeter of a meridian ellipse only amounts to 0.16%, it could
be shown only on a globe of unusual size.</p>

<p>The method of manufacturing a globe is much the same as it
was at the beginning of the 16th century. A matrix of wood or
iron is covered with successive layers of papers, pasted together
so as to form pasteboard. The shell thus formed is then cut along
the line of the intended equator into two hemispheres, they are
then again glued together and made to revolve round an axis the
ends of which passed through the poles and entered a metal
meridian circle. The sphere is then coated with plaster or
whiting, and when it has been smoothed on a lathe and dried, the
lines representing meridians and parallels are drawn upon it.
Finally the globe is covered with the paper gores upon which the
map is drawn. The adaption of these gores to the curvature
of the sphere calls for great care. Generally from 12 to 24 gores
and two small segments for the polar regions printed on vellum
paper are used for each globe. The method of preparing these
gores was originally found empirically, but since the days of
Albert Dürer it has also engaged the minds of many mathematicians,
foremost among whom was Professor A. G. Kästner of
Göttingen. One of the best instructions for the manufacture of
globes we owe to Altmütter of Vienna.<a name="fa8a" id="fa8a" href="#ft8a"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>Larger globes are usually on a stand the top of which supports
an artificial horizon. The globe itself rotates within a metallic
meridian to which its axis is attached. Other accessories are an
hour-circle, around the north pole, a compass placed beneath
the globe, and a flexible quadrant used for finding the distances
between places. These accessories are indispensable if it be
proposed to solve the problems usually propounded in books on
the &ldquo;use of the globes,&rdquo; but can be dispensed with if the globe
is to serve only as a map of the world. The size of a globe is
usually given in terms of its diameter. To find its scale divide
the mean diameter of the earth (1,273,500 m.) by the diameter
of the globe; to find its circumference multiply the diameter by
&pi; (3.1416).</p>

<p><i>Map Printing.</i>&mdash;Maps were first printed in the second half of the
15th century. Those in the <i>Rudimentum novitiarum</i> published
at Lübeck in 1475 are from woodcuts, while the maps in the first
two editions of Ptolemy published in Italy in 1472 are from
copper plates. Wood engraving kept its ground for a considerable
period, especially in Germany, but copper in the end supplanted
it, and owing to the beauty and clearness of the maps
produced by a combination of engraving and etching it still
maintains its ground. The objection that a copper plate shows
signs of wear after a thousand impressions have been taken has
been removed, since duplicate plates are readily produced by
electrotyping, while transfers of copper engravings, on stone,
zinc or aluminium, make it possible to turn out large editions in
a printing-machine, which thus supersedes the slow-working
hand-press.<a name="fa9a" id="fa9a" href="#ft9a"><span class="sp">9</span></a> These impressions from transfers, however, are
liable to be inferior to impressions taken from an original plate
or an electrotype. The art of lithography greatly affected the
production of maps. The work is either engraved upon the
stone (which yields the most satisfactory result at half the cost
of copper-engraving), or it is drawn upon the stone by pen, brush
or chalk (after the stone has been &ldquo;grained&rdquo;), or it is transferred
from a drawing upon transfer paper in lithographic ink. In
chromolithography a stone is required for each colour. Owing
to the great weight of stones, their cost and their liability of
being fractured in the press, zinc plates, and more recently
aluminium plates, have largely taken the place of stone. The
processes of zincography and of algraphy (aluminium printing)
are essentially the same as lithography. Zincographs are
generally used for producing surface blocks or plates which may
be printed in the same way as a wood-cut. Another process of
producing such blocks is known as cerography (Gr. <span class="grk" title="kêros">&#954;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span>), wax.
A copper plate having been coated with wax, outline and ornament
are cut into the wax, the lettering is impressed with type,
and the intaglio thus produced is electrotyped.<a name="fa10a" id="fa10a" href="#ft10a"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Movable types
are utilized in several other ways in the production of maps.
Thus the lettering of the map, having been set up in type, is
inked in and transferred to a stone or a zinc-plate, or it is
impressed upon transfer-paper and transferred to the stone.
Photographic processes have been utilized not only in reducing
maps to a smaller scale, but also for producing stones and plates
from which they may be printed. The manuscript maps intended
to be produced by photographic processes upon stone, zinc or aluminium,
are drawn on a scale somewhat larger than the scale on
which they are to be printed, thus eliminating all those imperfections
which are inherent in a pen-drawing. The saving in
time and cost by adopting this process is considerable, for a plan,
the engraving of which takes two years, can now be produced in
two days. Another process, photo- or heliogravure, for obtaining
an engraved image on a copper plate, was for the first time
employed on a large scale for producing a new topographical
map of the Austrian Empire in 718 sheets, on a scale of 1 : 75,000,
which was completed in seventeen years (1873-1890). The
original drawings for this map had to be done with exceptional
neatness, the draughtsman spending twelve months on that
which he would have completed in four months had it been
intended to engrave the map on copper; yet an average chart,
measuring 530 by 630 mm., which would have taken two years
and nine months for drawing and engraving, was completed in
less than fifteen months&mdash;fifty days of which were spent in
&ldquo;retouching&rdquo; the copper plate. It only cost £169 as compared
with £360 had the old method been pursued.</p>

<p>A capacity to understand the nature of maps is possessed even
by peoples whom we are in the habit of describing as &ldquo;savages.&rdquo;
Wandering tribes naturally enjoy a great advantage in this
respect over sedentary ones. Our arctic voyagers&mdash;Sir E. W.
Parry, Sir J. Ross, Sir F. L. MacClintock and others&mdash;have
profited from rough maps drawn for them by Eskimos. Specimens
of such maps are given in C. F. Hall&rsquo;s <i>Life with the Esquimaux</i>
(London, 1864). Henry Youle Hind, in his work on the
Labrador Peninsula (London, 1863) praises the map which the
Montagnais and Nasquapee Indians drew upon bark. Similar
essays at map-making are reported in connexion with Australians,
Maoris and Polynesians. Tupaya, a Tahitian, who accompanied
Captain Cook in the &ldquo;Endeavour&rdquo; to Europe, supplied his patron
with maps; Raraka drew a map in chalk of the Paumotu archipelago
on the deck of Captain Wilkes&rsquo;s vessel; the Marshall
islanders, according to Captain Winkler (<i>Marine Rundschau</i>, Oct.
1893) possess maps upon which the bearings of the islands are
indicated by small strokes. Far superior were the maps
found among the semi-civilized Mexicans when the <span class="correction" title="amended from Spainiards">Spaniards</span>
first discovered and invaded their country. Among them were
cadastral plans of villages, maps of the provinces of the empire of
the Aztecs, of towns and of the coast. Montezuma presented
Cortes with a map, painted on Nequen cloth, of the Gulf coast.
Another map did the Conquistador good service on his campaign
against Honduras (Lorenzana, <i>Historia de nueva España</i>, Mexico,
1770; W. H. Prescott, <i>History of the Conquest of Mexico</i>, New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page634" id="page634"></a>634</span>
York, 1843). Peru, the empire of the Incas, had not only
ordinary maps, but also maps in relief, for Pedro Sarmiento da
Gamboa (<i>History of the Incas</i>, translated by A. R. Markham,
1907) tells us that the 9th Inca (who died in 1191) ordered such
reliefs to be produced of certain localities in a district which he
had recently conquered and intended to colonize. These were
the first relief maps on record. It is possible that these primitive
efforts of American Indians might have been further developed,
but the Spanish conquest put a stop to all progress, and for a
consecutive history of the map and map-making we must turn to
the Old World, and trace this history from Egypt and Babylon,
through Greece, to our own age.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians were famed as &ldquo;geometers,&rdquo; and as
early as the days of Rameses II. (Sesostris of the Greeks, 1333-1300
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>) there had been made a cadastral survey of the country
showing the rows of pillars which separated the nomens as well as
the boundaries of landed estates. It was upon a map based upon
such a source that Eratosthenes (276-196 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) measured the
distance between Syene and Alexandria which he required for
his determination of the length of a degree. Ptolemy, who had
access to the treasures of the famous library of Alexandria was
able, no doubt, to utilize these cadastral plans when compiling
his <i>geography</i>. It should be noted that he places Syene only two
degrees to the east of Alexandria instead of three degrees, the
actual meridian distance between the two places; a difference
which would result from an error of only 7° is the orientation of
the map used by Ptolemy. Scarcely any specimens of ancient
Egyptian cartography have survived. In the Turin Museum are
preserved two papyri with rough drawings of gold mines established
by Sesostris in the Nubian Desert.<a name="fa11a" id="fa11a" href="#ft11a"><span class="sp">11</span></a> These drawings have
been commented upon by S. Birch, F. Chabas, R. J. Lauth and
other Egyptologists, and have been referred to as the two most
ancient maps in existence. They can, however, hardly be
described as maps, while in age they are surpassed by several
cartographical clay tablets discovered in Babylonia. On another
papyrus in the same museum is depicted the victorious return of
Seti I. (1366-1333) from Syria, showing the road from Pelusium
to Heroopolis, the canal from the Nile with crocodiles, and a
lake (mod. Lake Timsah) with fish in it. Apollonius of Rhodes
who succeeded Eratosthenes as chief librarian at Alexandria
(196 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) reports in his <i>Argonautica</i> (iv. 279) that the inhabitants
of Colchis whom, like Herodotus (ii., 104) he looks upon as the
descendants of Egyptian colonists, preserved, as heirlooms,
certain graven tablets (<span class="grk" title="kurbeis">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span>) on which land and sea, roads
and towns were accurately indicated.<a name="fa12a" id="fa12a" href="#ft12a"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Eustathius (since 1160
archbishop of Thessalonica) in his commentary on Dionysius
Periegetes, mentions route-maps which Sesostris caused to be
prepared, while Strabo (i., 1. 5) dwells at length upon the
wealth of geographical documents to be found in the library of
Alexandria.</p>

<p>A cadastral survey for purposes of taxation was already at
work in Babylonia in the age of Sargon of Akkad, 3800 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
In the British Museum may be seen a series of clay tablets,
circular in shape and dating back to 2300 or 2100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, which
contain surveys of lands. One of these depicts in a rough way
lower Babylonia encircled by a &ldquo;salt water river,&rdquo; Oceanus.</p>

<p><i>Development of Map-making among the Greeks.</i><a name="fa13a" id="fa13a" href="#ft13a"><span class="sp">13</span></a>&mdash;Ionian
mercenaries and traders first arrived in Egypt, on the invitation
of Psammetichus I. about the middle of the 7th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
Among the visitors to Egypt, there were, no doubt, some who
took an interest in the science of the Egyptians. One of
the most distinguished among them was Thales of Miletus
(640-543 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the founder of the Ionian school of philosophy,
whose pupil, Anaximander (611-546 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) is credited by Eratosthenes
with having designed the first map of the world. Anaximander
looked upon the earth as a section of a cylinder, of
considerable thickness, suspended in the centre of the circular
vault of the heavens, an idea perhaps borrowed from the Babylonians,
for Job (xxvi. 7) already speaks of the earth as &ldquo;hanging
upon nothing.&rdquo; Like Homer he looked upon the habitable
world (<span class="grk" title="oikoumenê">&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;</span>) as being circular in outline and bounded
by a circumfluent river. The geographical knowledge of
Anaximander was naturally more ample than that of Homer,
for it extended from the Cassiterides or Tin Islands in the west
to the Caspian in the east, which he conceived to open out into
Oceanus. The Aegean Sea occupied the centre of the map,
while the line where ocean and firmament seemed to meet
represented an enlarged horizon.</p>

<p>Anaximenes, a pupil of Anaximander, was the first to reject
the view that the earth was a circular plane, but held it to be
an oblong rectangle, buoyed up in the midst of the heavens by
the compressed air upon which it rested. Circular maps, however,
remained in the popular favour long after their erroneousness
had been recognized by the learned.</p>

<p>Even Hecataeus of Miletus (549-472 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the author of a
<i>Periodos</i> or description of the earth, of whom Herodotus borrowed
the terse saying that Egypt was the gift of the Nile, retained
this circular shape and circumfluent ocean when producing
his map of the world, although he had at his disposal the results
of the voyage of Scylax of Caryanda from the Indus to the
Red Sea, of Darius&rsquo; campaign in Scythia (513), the information
to be gathered among the merchants from all parts of the world
who frequented an emporium like Miletus, and what he had
learned in the course of his own extensive travels. Hecataeus
was probably the author of the &ldquo;bronze tablets upon which
was engraved the whole circuit of the earth, the sea and rivers&rdquo;
(Herod, v. 49), which Aristagoras, the tyrant of Miletus, showed
to Cleomenes, the king of Sparta, in 504, whose aid he sought
in vain in a proposed revolt against Darius, which resulted
disastrously in 494 in the destruction of Miletus. The map
of the world brought upon the stage in Aristophanes&rsquo; comedy
of <i>The Clouds</i> (423 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), whereon a disciple of the Sophists
points out upon it the position of Athens and of other places
known to the audience, was probably of the popular circular
type, which Herodotus (iv. 36) not many years before had
derided and which was discarded by Greek cartographers ever
after. Thus Democritus of Abdera (b. <i>c.</i> 450, d. after 360),
the great philosopher and founder, with Leucippus, of the
atomic theory, was also the author of a map of the inhabited
world which he supposed to be half as long again from west
to east, as it was broad.</p>

<p>Dicaearcus of Messana in Sicily, a pupil of Aristotle (326-296
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>), is the author of a topographical account of Hellas, with
maps, of which only fragments are preserved; he is credited
with having estimated the size of the earth, and, as far as known
he was the first to draw a parallel across a map.<a name="fa14a" id="fa14a" href="#ft14a"><span class="sp">14</span></a> This parallel,
or dividing line, called <i>diaphragm</i> (partition) by a commentator,
extended due east from the Pillars of Hercules, through the
Mediterranean, and along the Taurus and Imaus (Himalaya) to
the eastern ocean. It divided the inhabited world, as then
known, into a northern and a southern half. In compiling
his map he was able to avail himself of the information obtained
by the <i>bematists</i> (surveyors who determined distances by pacing)
who accompanied Alexander the Great on his campaigns;
of the results of the voyage of Nearchus from the Indus to the
Euphrates, and of the &ldquo;Periplus&rdquo; of Scylax of Caryanda,
which described the coast from between India and the head
of the Arabian Gulf. On the other hand he unwisely rejected
the results of the observations for latitude made by Pytheas
in 326 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> at his native town, Massilia, and during a subsequent
voyage to northern Europe. In the end the map of Dicaearcus
resembled that of Democritus.</p>

<p>Scientific geography profited largely from the labours of
Eratosthenes of Cyrene, whom Ptolemy Euergetes appointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page635" id="page635"></a>635</span>
keeper of the famous library of Alexandria in 247 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and
died in that city in 195 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> He won fame as having been the
first to determine the size of the earth by a scientific method.
Having determined the difference of latitude between Alexandria
and Syene which he erroneously believed to lie on the same
meridian, and obtained the distance of those places from each
other from the surveys made by Egyptian geometers, he
concluded that a degree of the <span class="correction" title="amended from meridan">meridian</span> measured 700 stadia.<a name="fa15a" id="fa15a" href="#ft15a"><span class="sp">15</span></a></p>

<p>Eratosthenes is the author of a treatise which deals systematically
with the geographical knowledge of his time, but of
which only fragments have been preserved by Strabo and others.
This treatise was intended to illustrate and explain his map of
the world. In this task he was much helped by the materials
collected in his library. Among the travellers of whose information
he was thus able to avail himself were Pytheas of Massilia,
Patroclus, who had visited the Caspian (285-282 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Megasthenes,
who visited Palibothra on the Ganges, as ambassador
of Seleucus Nicator (302-291 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Timosthenus of Rhodes,
the commander of the fleet of Ptolemy Philadelphus (284-246
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>) who wrote a treatise &ldquo;On harbours,&rdquo; and Philo, who visited
Meroe on the upper Nile. His map formed a parallelogram
measuring 75,800 stadia from Usisama (Ushant island) or
Sacrum Promontorium in the west to the mouth of the Ganges
and the land of the Coniaci (Comorin) in the east, and 46,000
stadia from Thule in the north to the supposed southern limit
of Libya. Across it were drawn seven parallels, running
through Meroe, Syene, Alexandria, Rhodes, Lysimachia on the
Hellespont, the mouth of the Borysthenes and Thule, and these
were crossed at right angles by seven meridians, drawn at
irregular intervals, and passing through the Pillars of Hercules,
Carthage, Alexandria, Thapsacus on the Euphrates, the Caspian
gates, the mouth of the Indus and that of the Ganges. The
position of all the places mentioned was supposed to have been
determined by trustworthy authorities. The inhabited world
thus delineated formed an island of irregular shape, surrounded
on all sides by the ocean, the Erythrean Sea freely communicating
with the western ocean. In his text Eratosthenes ignored
the popular division of the world into Europe, Asia and
Libya, and substituted for it a northern and southern division,
divided by the parallel of Rhodes, each of which he subdivided
into <i>sphragides</i> or <i>plinthia</i>&mdash;seals or plinths. The principles
on which these divisions were made remain an enigma to the
present day.</p>

<p>This map of Eratosthenes, notwithstanding its many errors,
such as the assumed connexion of the Caspian with a northern
ocean and the supposition that Carthage, Sicily and Rome lay
on the same meridian, enjoyed a high reputation in his day.
Even Strabo (<i>c.</i> 30 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) adopted its main features, but while
he improved the European frontier, he rejected the valuable
information secured by Pytheas and retained the connexion
between the Caspian and the outer ocean. In the extreme
east his information extended no further than that of Eratosthenes,
viz. to India and Taprobane (Ceylon) and the Sacae
(Kirghiz).</p>

<p>Hipparchus, the famous astronomer, on the other hand,
(<i>c.</i> 150 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) proved a somewhat captious critic. He justly
objected to the arbitrary network of the map of Eratosthenes.
The parallels or <i>climata</i><a name="fa16a" id="fa16a" href="#ft16a"><span class="sp">16</span></a> drawn through places, of which the
longest day is of equal length and the decimation (distance)
from the equator is the same, he maintained, ought to have
been inserted at equal intervals, say of half an hour, and the
meridians inserted on a like principle. In fact, he demanded
that maps should be based upon a regular projection, several
descriptions of which he had adopted for his star maps. He
moreover accuses Eratosthenes, (whose determination of a
degree he accepts without hesitation) with trusting too much
to hypothesis in compiling his map instead of having recourse
to latitudes and longitudes deduced by astronomical observations.
Such observations, however, were but rarely available
at the time. A few latitudes had indeed been observed, but
although Hipparchus had shown how longitudes could be
determined by the observation of eclipses, this method was in
reality not available for want of trustworthy time-keepers.
The determination of an ocean surrounding the inhabited earth
he declared to be based on a mere hypothesis and that it
would be equally allowable to describe the Erythraea as a sea
surrounded by land. Hipparchus is not known to have compiled
a map himself.</p>

<p>About the same time Crates of Mallus (d. 145 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) embodied
the views of the Stoic school of philosophy in a globe which
has become typical as one of the insignia of royalty. On this
globe an equatorial and a meridional ocean divide our earth
into four quarters, each inhabited, thus anticipating the discovery
of North and South America and Australia.<a name="fa17a" id="fa17a" href="#ft17a"><span class="sp">17</span></a></p>

<p>The period between Eratosthenes and Marinus of Tyre was
one of great political importance. Carthage had been destroyed
(146 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Julius Caesar had carried on his campaign in Gaul
(58-51 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Egypt had been occupied (30 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Britannia
conquered (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 41-79), and the Roman empire had attained
its greatest extent and power under the emperor Trajan (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 98-117).
But although military operations added to our knowledge
of the world, scientific cartography was utterly neglected.</p>

<p>Among Greek works written during this period there are
several which either give us an idea of the maps available at
that time, or furnish information of direct service to the compiler
of a map. Among the latter a Periplus or coastal guide of the
Erythrean Sea, which clearly reveals the peninsular shape of
India (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 90) and Arrian&rsquo;s <i>Periplus Ponti Euxeni</i> (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 131)
which Festus Avienus translated into Latin. Among travellers
Eudoxus of Cyzicus occupies a foremost rank, since, between
115-87 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he visited India and the east coast of Africa, which
subsequently he attempted in vain to circumnavigate by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page636" id="page636"></a>636</span>
following the route of Hanno, along the west coast. Among
geographers should be mentioned Posidonius (<span class="correction" title="amended from 13-551">135-51</span>), the head
of the Stoic school of Rhodes, who is stated to be responsible for
having reduced the length of a degree to 500 stadia; Artemidorus
of Ephesus, whose &ldquo;Geographumena&rdquo; (<i>c.</i> 100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) are based
upon his own travels and a study of itineraries, and above all,
Strabo, who has already been referred to. Among historians
who looked upon geography as an important aid in their work
are numbered Polybius (<i>c.</i> 210-120 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Diodorus Siculus
(<i>c.</i> 30 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and Agathachidus of Cnidus (<i>c.</i> 120 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) to whom
we are indebted for a valuable account of the Erythrean Sea
and the adjoining parts of Arabia and Ethiopia. The <i>Periegesis</i>
of Dionysius of Alexandria is a popular description of the world
in hexameters, of no particular scientific value (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 130).
He as well as Artemidorus and others accepted a circular or
ellipsoidal shape of the world and a circumfluent ocean; Strabo
alone adhered to the scientific theories of Eratosthenes.</p>

<p>The credit of having returned to the scientific principles
innovated by Eratosthenes and Hipparchus is due to Marinus of
Tyre (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 120) which, though no longer occupying the pre-eminent
position of former times, was yet an emporium of no
inconsiderable importance, having extensive connexions by sea
and land. The map of Marinus and the descriptive accounts
which accompanied it have perished, but we learn sufficient
concerning them from Ptolemy to be able to appreciate their
merits and demerits. Marinus was the first who laid down the
position of places on a projection according to their latitude
and longitude, but the projection used by him was of the rudest.
Parallels and meridians were represented by straight lines
intersecting each other at right angles, the relative proportions
between degrees of longitude and latitude being retained only
along the parallel of Rhodes. The distortion of the countries
represented would thus increase with the distance, north and
south, from this central parallel. The number of places whose
position had been determined by astronomical observation
was as yet very small, and the map had thus to be compiled
mainly from itineraries furnished by travellers or the dead
reckoning of seamen. The errors due to an exaggeration of
distances were still further increased on account of his assuming
a degree to be equal to 500 stadia, as determined by Posidonius,
instead of accepting the 700 stadia of Eratosthenes. He was
thus led to assume that the distance from the first meridian
drawn through the Fortunate islands to Sera (mod. Si-ngan-fu),
the capital of China, was equal to 225°, which Ptolemy reduced
to 177°, but which in reality only amount to 126°. A like
overestimate of the distances covering the march of Julius
Maternus to Agisymba, which Marinus places 24° south of the
equator, a latitude which Ptolemy reduces to 18°, but which is
probably no farther south than lat. 12° N. The map of Marinus
was accompanied by a list of places arranged according to latitude
and longitude. It must have been much in demand, for three
editions of it were prepared. Masudi (10th century) saw a copy
of it and declared it to be superior to Ptolemy&rsquo;s map.</p>

<p>Ptolemy (<i>q.v.</i>) was the author of a <i>Geography</i><a name="fa18a" id="fa18a" href="#ft18a"><span class="sp">18</span></a> (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 150)
in eight books. &ldquo;Geography,&rdquo; in the sense in which he uses
the term, signifies the delineation of the known world, in the
shape of a map, while chorography carries out the same objects
in fuller detail, with regard to a particular country. In Book I.
he deals with the principles of mathematical geography, map
projections, and sources of information with special reference
to his predecessor Marinus. Books II. to VII. form an index
to the maps. They contain about 8000 names, with their
latitudes and longitudes, and with their aid it is possible to
reconstruct the maps. These maps existed, as a matter of
course, before such an index could be compiled, but it is doubtful
whether the maps in our available manuscript, which are attributed
to Agathodaemon, are copies of Ptolemy&rsquo;s originals or
have been compiled, after their loss, from this index. Book
VIII. gives further details with reference to the principal
towns of each map, as to geographical position, length of day,
climata, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Ptolemy&rsquo;s great merit consists in having accepted the views
of Hipparchus with respect to a projection suited for a map of
the world. Of the two projections proposed by him one is a
modified conical projection with curved parallels and straight
meridians; in the second projection (see fig. 3) both parallels and
meridians are curved. The correct relations in the length of
degrees of latitude and longitude are maintained in the first
case along the latitude of Thule and the equator, in the second
along the parallel of Agisymba, the equator and the parallels
of Meroe, Syene and Thule. Following Hipparchus he divided
the equator into 360° drawing his prime meridian through the
Fortunate Islands (Canaries). The 26 special maps are drawn
on a rectangular projection. As a map compiler Ptolemy does
not take a high rank. In the main he copied Marinus whose
work he revised and supplemented in some points, but he failed
to realize the peninsular shape of India, erroneously exaggerated
the size of Taprobane (Ceylon), and suggested that the Indian
Ocean had no connexion with the western ocean, but formed
Mare Clausum. Ptolemy knew but of a few latitudes which had
been determined by actual observation, while of three longitudes
resulting from simultaneous observation of eclipses he unfortunately
accepted the least satisfactory, namely, that which
placed Arbela 45° to the east of Carthage, while the actual
meridian distance only amounts to 34°. An even graver source
of error was Ptolemy&rsquo;s acceptance of a degree of 500 instead of
700 stadia. The extent to which the more correct proportion
would have affected the delineation of the Mediterranean is
illustrated by fig. 4. But in spite of his errors the scientific
method pursued by Ptolemy was correct, and though he was
neglected by the Romans and during the middle ages, once he
had become known, in the 15th century, he became the teacher
of the modern world.</p>

<p><i>Map-Making among the Romans.</i>&mdash;We learn from Cicero,
Vitruvius, Seneca, Suetonius, Pliny and others, that the Romans
had both general and topographical maps. Thus, Varro (<i>De
rustici</i>) mentions a map of Italy engraved on marble, in the
temple of Tellus, Pliny, a map of the seat of war in Armenia, of
the time of the emperor Nero, and the more famous map of the
Roman Empire which was ordered to be prepared for Julius
Caesar (44 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), but only completed in the reign of Augustus,
who placed a copy of it, engraved in marble, in the Porticus of
his sister Octavia (7 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the son-in-law
of Augustus (d. 12 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), who superintended the completion of
this famous map, also wrote a commentary illustrating it,
quotations from which of Ammianus Marcellinus of Antioch
(d. 330), Pliny and others, afford the only means of judging of
its character. The map is supposed to be based upon actual
surveys or rather reconnaissances, and if it be borne in mind that
the Roman Empire at that time was traversed in all directions
by roads furnished with mile-stones, that the Agrimensores
employed upon such a duty were skilled surveyors, and that the
official reports of the commanders of military expeditions and
of provincial governors were available, this map, as well as the
provincial maps upon which it was based, must have been a work
of superior excellence, the loss of which is much to be regretted.
A copy of it may possibly have been utilized by Marinus and
Ptolemy in their compilations. The Romans have been reproached
for having neglected the scientific methods of map-making
advocated by Hipparchus. Their maps, however, seem
to have met the practical requirements of political administration
and of military undertakings.</p>

<p>Only two specimens of Roman cartography have come down
to us, viz. parts of a plan of Rome, of the time of the emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page637" id="page637"></a>637</span>
Septimius Severus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 193-211), now in the Museo Capitolino,
and an <i>itinerarium scriptum</i>, or road map of the world, compressed
within a strip 745 mm. in length and 34 mm. broad.
Of its character the reduced copy of one of its 12 sections (fig. 5)
conveys an idea. The map, apparently of the 3rd century,
was copied by a monk at Colmar, in 1265, who fortunately
contented himself with adding a few scriptural names, and
having been acquired by the learned Conrad Peutinger of
Augsburg it became known as <i>Tabula peutingeriana</i>. The
original is now in the imperial library of Vienna.<a name="fa19a" id="fa19a" href="#ft19a"><span class="sp">19</span></a></p>

<p><i>Map-Making in the Middle Ages.</i>&mdash;In scientific matters the
early middle ages were marked by stagnation and retrogression.
The fathers of the church did not encourage scientific pursuits,
which Lactantius (4th century) declared to be unprofitable. The
doctrine of the sphericity of the earth was still held by the more
learned, but the heads of the church held it to be unscriptural.
Pope Zachary, when in 741 he condemned the views of Virgilius,
the learned bishop of Salzburg, an Irishman who had been
denounced as a heretic by St Boniface, declares it to be <i>perversa
et iniqua doctrina</i>. Even after Gerbert of Aurillac, better known
as Pope Sylvester II. (999-1063), Adam of Bremen (1075),
Albertus Magnus (d. 1286), Roger Bacon (d. 1294), and indeed
all men of leading had accepted as a fact and not a mere hypothesis
the geocentric system of the universe and sphericity of
the globe, the authors of maps of the world, nearly all of whom
were monks, still looked in the main to the Holy Scriptures
for guidance in outlining the inhabited world. We have to
deal thus with three types of these early maps, viz. an oblong
rectangular, a circular and an oval type, the latter being either
a compromise between the two former, or an artistic development
of the circular type. In every instance the inhabited world is
surrounded by the ocean. The authors of rectangular maps
look upon the Tabernacle as an image of the world at large, and
believe that such expressions as the &ldquo;four corners of the earth&rdquo;
(Isa. x. 12), could be reconciled only with a rectangular world.
On the other hand there was the expression &ldquo;circuit of the
earth&rdquo; (Isa. xl. 22), and the statement (Ezek. v. 5) that &ldquo;God
had set Jerusalem in the midst of the nations and countries.&rdquo; In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page638" id="page638"></a>638</span>
nearly every case the East occupies the top of the map. Neither
parallels nor meridians are indicated, nor is there a scale. Other
features frequently met with are the Paradise in the Far East,
miniatures of towns, plants, animals, human beings and monsters,
and an indication of the twelve winds around the margin.</p>

<p>The oldest rectangular map of the world is contained in a
most valuable work written by Cosmas, an Alexandrian monk,
surnamed Indicopleustes, after
returning from a voyage to
India (535 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>), and entitled
<i>Christian Topography</i>. According
to Cosmas (fig. 6) the
inhabited earth has the shape
of an oblong rectangle surrounded
by an ocean which
breaks in in four great gulfs&mdash;the
Roman or Mediterranean,
the Arabian, Persian and
Caspian Sea. Beyond this
ocean lies another world, which
was occupied by man before
the Deluge, and within which
Cosmas placed the Terrestrial
Paradise. Above this rise the walls of the heavens like
unto the tent of the Tabernacle. Far more simple is a small
map of the world of the 8th century found in a codex in the
library of Albi, an archiepiscopal seat in the department of
Tarn. Its scanty nomenclature is almost wholly derived
from the &ldquo;Historiae adversum paganos&rdquo; of Paulus Orosius
(418). Far greater interest attaches to the so-called Anglo-Saxon
Map of the World in the British Museum (Cotton
MSS.), where it is bound up in a codex which also contains a
copy of the <i>Periegesis</i> of Priscianus. Map and Periegesis are
copies by the same hand, but no other connexion exists between
them. More than half the nomenclature of the map is derived
from Orosius, an annotated Anglo-Saxon version of which had
been produced by King Alfred (871-901). The Anglo-Saxons
of the time were of course well acquainted with Island (first
thus named in 870) Slesvic and Norweci (Norway), and there is
no need to have recourse to Adam of Bremen (1076) to account
for their presence upon this map. The broad features of the
map were derived no doubt from an older document which may
likewise have served as the basis for the map of the world
engraved on silver for Charlemagne, and was also consulted by
the compilers of the Hereford and Ebstorf maps (see fig. 11).</p>

<p>The outlines of several medieval maps resemble each other
to such an extent that there can be no doubt that they are
derived from the same original source. This source by some
authors is assumed to have been the official map of the Roman
Empire, but if we compare the crude outline given to the
Mediterranean with the more correct delineation of Ptolemy,
who was certainly in a position to avail himself of these official
sources, such an assumption is untenable. The earliest delineation
of the description has already been referred to as the Anglo-Saxon
map of the world. Next in the order of age, follows the
oval map which Henry, canon of Mayence Cathedral, dedicated
to Mathilda, consort of the emperor Henry V. (1110). Of far
greater importance is the map seen in Hereford Cathedral. It is
the work of Richard of Haldingham, and has a diameter of 134
cm. (53 ins.). The &ldquo;survey&rdquo; ordered by Julius Caesar is referred
to in the legend, evidently derived from the Cosmography of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page639" id="page639"></a>639</span>
Aethicus a work widely read at the time, but this does not prove
that the author was able to avail himself of a map based upon
that survey. A map essentially identical with that of Hereford,
but larger&mdash;its diameter is 15.6 cm. (6 in.), and consequently
fuller of information&mdash;was discovered in 1830 in the old monastery
of Ebstorf in Hanover. Its date is 1484. Both maps
abound in miniature pictures of towns, animals, fabulous beings
and other subjects. The Hereford map is surmounted by a
picture of the Day of Judgment. Similar in design, though
much smaller of scale and oval in form, are the maps which
illustrate the popular <i>Polychronicon</i> of Ranulf Higden, a monk
of St Werburgh&rsquo;s Abbey of Chester (d. 1363).</p>

<p>Pomponius Mela tells us that beyond the Ethiopian Ocean
which sweeps round Africa in the south and the uninhabitable
torrid zone, there lies an <i>alter orbis</i>, or fourth part of the world
inhabited by <i>Antichthones</i>. On a diagram illustrating the
origines of Isidore of Seville (d. 636) this country is shown, but
is described as a <i>terra inhabitabilis</i>. It is shown likewise upon
a number of maps which illustrate the <i>Commentaries on the
Apocalypse</i>, by Beatus, a Benedictine monk of the abbey of
Valcavado at the foot of the hills of Liebana in Asturia (776).</p>

<p>Our little map (fig. 12) is taken from a copy of Beatus&rsquo; work
made in 1203, and preserved at Burgo de Osma in Castille. Similar
maps illustrating the <i>Commentaries</i> exist at St Sever (1050),
Paris (1203), and Tunis; others are rectangular, the oldest being
in Lord Ashburnham&rsquo;s library (970). Beatus, too, describes the
southern land as <i>inhabitabilis</i>. The habitable world is divided
among the twelve apostles, whose portraits are given. On the
maps illustrating the encyclopaedic <i>Liber floridus</i> by Lambert,
a canon of St Omer (1120), this south land &ldquo;unknown to the
sons of Adam,&rdquo; is stated to be inhabited &ldquo;according to the
philosophers&rdquo; by Antipodes. Lambert, indeed, seems to have
believed in the sphericity of the earth. Fig. 13 shows his map of
the world reduced from a MS. at Wolfenbüttel, to which is added
a diagram of the zones from a MS. at Ghent, which illustrates
Macrobius&rsquo; commentary on Cicero&rsquo;s <i>Somnium Scipionis</i>. Diagrams
illustrating the division of the world into climata, are
to be found in the <i>opus majus</i> of Roger Bacon (d. 1294) and in
Cardinal Pierre d&rsquo;Ailly&rsquo;s <i>De imagine Mundi</i> (1410).</p>

<p>Among countries represented on a larger scale on maps,
Palestine not unnaturally occupies a prominent place in this
age of pilgrimages and crusades (1095-1291). The maps which
accompany St Jerome&rsquo;s translation of the <i>Onomasticon</i> of St
Eusebius (388). The same subject is illustrated by a picture-map
in mosaic, portions of which were discovered in 1896 on the floor
of the church of Madaba to the east of the Dead Sea. This is
the oldest original of a map in existence, for it dates back to the
6th century. Among more recent maps of Palestine, that by
Petrus Vesconte (1320) is greatly superior to the earlier maps.
It illustrates Marino Sanuto&rsquo;s <i>Secreta fidelium crucis</i>, in which
its author vainly appeals to Christendom to undertake another
crusade. One of the earliest plans of Jerusalem is contained in
<i>Gesta Francorum</i>, a history of the Crusades up to 1106, based
upon information furnished by Fulcherius of Chartres (<i>c.</i> 1109).</p>

<p>There existed, no doubt, special maps of European countries,
but the only documents of that description are two maps of
Great Britain, the one of the 12th
century, the other by Matthew of

<p>Celestial globes were known in
the time of Bede; they formed
part of the educational apparatus
of the monastic schools. Gerbert
of Aurillac is known to have made
such globes (929). Their manufacture
is described by Alphonso the
Wise (1252), as also in <i>De sphaera
solida</i> of G. Campanus of Novara
(1303). Terrestrial globes, however,

<p><i>Map-making among the Arabians
and other Nations of the East.</i>&mdash;Bagdad
early became a famous
seat of learning. Indian astronomers
found apt pupils there among the Arabs; the works of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page640" id="page640"></a>640</span>
Ptolemy were translated into Arabic, and in 827, in the reign
of the caliph Abdullah al Mamun, an arc of the meridian was
measured in the plain of Mesopotamia. Most famous among
these Arabian astronomers were Al Batani (d. 998), Ibn Yunis of
Cairo (d. 1008), Zarkala (Azarchel), who determined the meridian
distance between his observatory in Toledo and Bagdad to
amount to 51° 30&prime;, an error of 3° only, as compared with Ptolemy&rsquo;s
error of 18°, and Abul Hassan (1230) who reduced the great
axis of the Mediterranean to 44°.</p>

<p>Further materials serviceable to the compilers of maps were
supplied by numerous Arabian travellers and geographers, among
whom Masudi (915-940), Istakhri (950), Ibn Haukal (942-970),
Al Biruni (d. 1038), Ibn Batuta (1325-1356) and Abul
Feda (1331-1370), occupy a foremost place, yet the few maps
which have reached us are crude in the extreme. Masudi, who
saw the maps in the Horismos or Rasm el Ard, a description of
the world by Abu Jafar Mahommed ben Musa of Khiva, the
librarian of the caliph el Mamun (833), declares them to be
superior to the maps of Ptolemy or Marinus, but maps of a later
date by Istakhri (950) or Ibn al Wardi (1349) are certainly of a
most rudimentary type. Nor can Idrisi&rsquo;s map of the world,
which was engraved for King Roger of Sicily upon a silver
plate, or the rectangular map in 70 sheets which accompanies
his geography (Nushat-ul Mushtat) take rank with Ptolemy&rsquo;s
work. These maps are based upon information collected during
many years at the instance of King Roger. The seven climates
adopted by Idrisi are erroneously supposed to be equal in latitudinal
extent. The Mediterranean occupies nearly half the
inhabited world in longitude, and the east coast of Africa is
shown as if it extended due east.</p>

<p>The Arabians are not known to have produced a terrestrial
globe, but several of their celestial globes are to be found in our
collections. The oldest of these globes was made at Valentia,
and is now in the museum of Florence. Another globe (of 1225)
is at Velletri; a third by Ibn Hula of Mosul (1275) is the property
of the Royal Asiatic Society of London; a fourth (1289) from the
observatory of Maragha, in the Dresden Museum, two globes
of uncertain age at Paris (see fig. 17) and another in London.
All these globes are of metal (bronze), or they might not have
survived so many years.</p>

<p>The charts in use of the medieval navigators of the Indian
Ocean&mdash;Arabs, Persians or Dravidas&mdash;were equal in value if
not superior to the charts of the Mediterranean. Marco Polo
mentions such charts; Vasco da Gama (1498) found them in
the hands of his Indian pilot, and their nature is fully explained
in the <i>Mohit</i> or encyclopaedia of the sea compiled from ancient
sources by the Turkish admiral Sidi Ali Ben Hosein in 1554.<a name="fa21a" id="fa21a" href="#ft21a"><span class="sp">21</span></a>
These charts are covered with a close network of lines intersecting
each other at right angles. The horizontal lines are parallels,
depending upon the altitude of the pole star, the Calves of the
Little Bear and the Barrow of the Great Bear above the horizon.
This altitude was expressed in <i>isbas</i> or inches each equivalent
to 1° 42&prime; 50&Prime;. Each <i>isba</i> was divided into <i>zams</i> or eights. The
interval between two parallels thus only amounted to 12&prime; 51&Prime;.
These intervals were mistaken by the Portuguese occasionally
for degrees, which account for Malacca, which is in lat. 2&prime; 13&Prime;
N., being placed on Cantino&rsquo;s Chart (1502) in lat. 14&prime; S. It may
have been a map of this kind which accounts for Ptolemy&rsquo;s
moderate exaggerations of the size of Taprobana (Ceylon). A
first meridian, separating a leeward from a windward region,
passed through Ras Kumhari (Comorin) and was thus nearly
identical with the first meridian of the Indian astronomers
which passed through the sacred city of Ujjain (Ozere of Ptolemy)
or the meridian of Azin of the Arabs. Additional meridians
were drawn at intervals of <i>zams</i>, supposed to be equal to three
hours&rsquo; sail.</p>

<p>In China, maps in the olden time were engraved on bronze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page641" id="page641"></a>641</span>
or stone, but after the 10th century they were printed from
wood-blocks. Among the more important productions of more
recent times, may be mentioned a map of the empire, said to be
based upon actual surveys by Yhang (721), who also manufactured
a celestial globe (an older globe by Ho-shing-tien, 4 metres in
circumference, was produced in 450), and an atlas of the empire on
a large scale by Thu-sie-pun (1311-1312) of which new enlarged
editions with many maps were published in the 16th century and
in 1799. None of these maps was graduated, which is all the
more surprising as the Chinese astronomers are credited with
having made use of the gnomon as early as 1000 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> for determining
latitudes.</p>

<p><i>Portolano Maps.</i>&mdash;During the long period of stagnation in
cartography, which we have already dealt with, there survived
among the seamen of the Mediterranean charts of remarkable
accuracy, illustrating the <i>Portolani</i> or sailing directories in use
among them. Charts of this description are first mentioned in
connexion with the Crusade of Louis XI. in 1270, but they
originated long before that time, and in the eastern part of the
Mediterranean they embody materials available even in the days
before Ptolemy, while the correct delineation of the west seems
to be of a later date, and may have been due to Catalan seamen.
These charts are based upon estimated bearings and distances
between the principal ports or capes, the intervening coast-line
being filled in from more detailed surveys. The bearings were
dependent upon the seaman&rsquo;s observation of the heavens, for
these charts were in use long before the compass had been
introduced on board ship (as early as 1205, according to Guiot de
Provins) although it became fully serviceable only after the needle
had been attached to the compass card, an improvement probably
introduced by Flavio Gioja of Amalfi in the beginning of
the 14th century. The compass may of course have been used
for improving these charts, but they originated without its aid,
and it is therefore misleading to describe them as <i>Compass or
Loxodromic</i> charts, and they are now known as <i>Portolano</i> charts.</p>

<p class="pt2">None of these charts is graduated, and the horizontal and
vertical lines which cross many of them represent neither
parallels nor meridians. Their most characteristic feature, and
one by which they can most readily be recognized, is presented
by groups or systems of rhumb-lines, each group of these lines
radiating from a common centre,
the central group being generally
encircled by eight or sixteen satellite
groups. In the course of time
the centres of radiation of all these
groups had imposed upon them
ornate <i>rose dei venti</i>, or windroses,
such as may still be seen upon our
compass-cards. Each chart was furnished
with a scale of miles. These
miles, however, were not the ordinary
Roman miles of 1000 paces or
5000 ft., but smaller miles of Greek
or Oriental origin, of which six were
equal to five Roman miles, and as
the latter were equal to 1480 metres,
the Portolano miles had a length of
only 1233 metres, and 75.2 of the
former, and 90.3 of the latter were
equal to a degree. The difference
between these miles was known,
however, only to the more learned
among the map-makers, and when
the charts were extended to the
Atlantic seaboard the two were
assumed to be identical.</p>

<p>On these old charts the Mediterranean
is delineated with surprising
fidelity. The meridian distance between
the Straits of Gibraltar and
Beirut in Syria amounts upon them
to about 3000 Portolano miles, equal
in lat. 36° N. to 40.9°, as compared
with an actual difference of 41.2°,
and a difference of 61° assumed by
Ptolemy. There exists, however, a
serious error of orientation, due, according
to Professor H. Wagner, to
the inexperience of the cartographers
who first combined the charts of the separate basins of the
Mediterranean so as to produce a chart of the whole. This
accounts for Gibraltar and Alexandria being shown as lying
due east and west of each other, although there is a difference of
5° of latitude between them, a fact known long before Ptolemy.</p>

<p>The production of these charts employed numerous licensed
draughtsmen in the principal seaports of Italy and Catalonia,
and among seamen these MS. charts remained popular long
after the productions of the printing-press had become available.
The oldest of these maps which have been preserved, the so-called
&ldquo;Pisan chart,&rdquo; which belongs probably to the middle of
the 13th century, and a set of eight charts, known by the name
of its former owner, the Cavaliere Tamar Luxoro, of somewhat
later date, are both the work of Genoese artists. Among more
eminent Genoese cartographers are Joannes da Carignano
(d. 1344), Petrus Vesconte, who worked in 1311 and 1327, and is
the draughtsman of the maps illustrating Marino Sanuto&rsquo;s <i>Liber
secretorum fidelium crucis</i>, which was to have roused Christendom
to engage in another crusade (figs. 19 and 21) Battista
Beccario (1426, 1435) and Bartolomeo Pareto (1455). Venice
ranks next to Genoa as a centre of cartographic activity. Associated
with it are Francesco Pizigano (1367-1373), Francesco de
Cesanis (1421), Giacomo Giroldi (1422-1446), Andrea Bianco
(1436-1448) Giovanni Leardo (1442-1452), Alvise Cadamosto,
who was associated with the Portuguese explorers on the west
coast of Africa (1454-1456) and whose <i>Portolano</i> was printed at
Venice in 1490, and Fra Mauro (1457).</p>

<p>Associated with Ancona are Grazioso Benincasa and his son
Andreas, whose numerous charts were produced between 1461
and 1508, and Count Ortomano Freducci (1497-1538).</p>

<p>The earliest among Majorcan and Catalonian cartographers
is Angelino Dulcert (1325-1339) whom A. Managhi claims as a
Genoese, whose true name according to him was Angelino Dalorto.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page643" id="page643"></a>643</span>
Other Catalans are Jahuda Cresques, a Jew of Barcelona, the
supposed author of the famous Catalan map of the world (1375),
Guglielmo Solerio (1384), Mecia de Viladestes (1413-1433)
Gabriel de Valleseche (1439-1447) and Pietro
Roselli, a pupil of Beccario of Genoa (1462).</p>

<p>These maps were originally intended for the
use of seamen navigating the Mediterranean and
the coasts of the Atlantic, but in the course of
time they were extended to the mainland and
ultimately developed into maps of the whole
world as then known. Thus Pizigano&rsquo;s map of
1367 extends as far east as the Gulf of Persia,
whilst the Medicean map of 1356 (at Florence)
is remarkable on account of a fairly correct
delineation of the Caspian, the Shari river in
Africa, and the correct direction given to the
west coast of India, which had already been
pointed out in a letter of the friar Giovanni da
Montecorvino of 1252. Most of the expansions
of Portolano maps into maps of the world are
circular in shape, and resemble the wheel maps
of an earlier period. This is the character of the
map of Petrus Vesconte of 1320 (fig. 21), of
Giovanni Leardo (1448) and of a Catalan map of
1450. Jerusalem occupies the centre of these
maps, Arab sources of information are largely
drawn upon, while Ptolemy is neglected and contemporary
travellers are ignored. Far superior
to these maps is Fra Mauro&rsquo;s map (1457), for the
author has availed himself not only of the information collected
by Marco Polo and earlier travellers, but was able, by personal
intercourse, to gather additional information from Nicolo de&rsquo;
Conti, who had returned from the east in 1440, and more especially
from Abyssinians who lived in Italy at that time. His
delineation of Abyssinia, though unduly spread over a wide area,
is indeed wonderfully correct.</p>

<p>Very different in character is the Catalan map of 1375, for its
author, discarding Ptolemy, shows India as a peninsula. On
the other hand, an anonymous Genoese would-be reformer of
maps (1457; fig. 24), still adheres to the erroneous Ptolemaic
delineation of southern Asia, and the same error is perpetuated
by Henricus Marvellus Germanus on a rough map showing the
Portuguese discoveries up to 1489. None of these maps is
graduated, but if we give the Mediterranean a length of 3000
Portolano miles, equivalent in 36° N. to 41°, then the longitudinal
extent of the old world as measured on the Genoese map of 1457
would be 136° instead of 177° or more as given by Ptolemy.</p>

<p><i>The Revival of Ptolemy.</i>&mdash;Ptolemy&rsquo;s great work became known
in western Europe after Jacobus Angelus de Scarparia had
translated it into Latin in 1410. This version was first printed
in 1475 at Vicenza, but its contents had become known through
MS. copies before this, and their study influenced the construction
of maps in two respects. They led firstly to the addition of
degree lines to maps, and secondly to the compilation of new maps
of those countries which had been inadequately represented by
Ptolemy. Thus Claudius Clavus Swartha (Niger), who was at
Rome in 1424, compiled a map of the world, extending westward
as far as Greenland. The learned Cardinal Nicolaus Krebs, of
Cusa (Cues) on the Moselle, who died 1464, drew a map of Germany
which was first published in 1491; D. Nicolaus Germanus,
a monk of Reichenbach, in 1466 prepared a set of Ptolemy&rsquo;s
maps on a new projection with converging meridians; and Paolo
del Pozzo Toscanelli in 1474 compiled a new chart on a rectangular
projection, which was to guide the explorer across the
western ocean to Cathay and India.</p>

<p>Of the seven editions of Ptolemy which were published up
to the close of the 15th century, all except that of Vicenza (1475)
contained Ptolemy&rsquo;s 27 maps, while Francesco Berlinghieri&rsquo;s
version (Florence 1478), and two editions published at Ulm
(1482 and 1486), contained four or five modern maps in addition,
those of Ulm being by Nicolaus Germanus.</p>

<p>The geographical ideas which prevailed at the time Columbus
started in search of Cathay may be most readily gathered from
two contemporary globes, the one known as the Laon globe
because it was picked up in 1860 at a curiosity shop in that town,
the other produced at Nuremberg in 1492 by Martin Behaim.<a name="fa22a" id="fa22a" href="#ft22a"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
The Laon globe is of copper gilt, and has a diameter of 170 mm.
The information which it furnishes, in spite of a legend intended
to lead us to believe that it presents us with the results of Portuguese
explorations up to the year 1493, is of more ancient date.
The Nuremberg globe is a work of a more ambitious order. It was
undertaken at the suggestion of George Holzschuher, a travelled
member of the town council. The work was entrusted to Martin
Behaim, who had resided for six years in Portugal and the Azores,
and was believed to be a thoroughly qualified cosmographer.

The globe is of pasteboard covered with whiting and parchment,
and has a diameter of 507 mm. The author followed
Ptolemy not only in Asia, but also in the Mediterranean. He
did not avail himself of the materials available in his day.
Not even the coasts of western Africa are laid down correctly,
although the author claimed to have taken part in one of the
Portuguese expeditions. The ocean separating Europe from
Asia is assumed as being only 126° wide, in accordance with
Toscanelli&rsquo;s ideas of 1474. Very inadequate use has been made
of the travels of Marco Polo, Nicolo de&rsquo; Conti, and of others
in the east.<a name="fa23a" id="fa23a" href="#ft23a"><span class="sp">23</span></a> On the other hand, the globe is made gay with
flags and other decorations, the work of George Glockendon,
a well-known illuminator of the time.</p>

<p>The maritime discoveries and surveys of that age of great
discoveries were laid down upon so-called &ldquo;plane-charts,&rdquo;
that is, charts having merely equidistant parallels indicated
upon them, together with the equator, the tropics and polar
circles, or, in a more advanced stage, meridians also. The astrolabe
quadrant or cross-staff enabled the mariner to determine his
latitude with a certain amount of accuracy, but for his longitude
he was dependent upon dead reckoning, for although various
methods for determining a longitude were known, the available
astronomical ephemerides were not trustworthy, and errors of
30° in longitude were by no means rare. It was only after the
publication of Kepler&rsquo;s <i>Rudolphine Table</i> (1626) that more exact
results could be obtained. A further difficulty arose in connexion
with the variation of the compass, which induced Pedro Reinel
to introduce two scales of latitude on his map of the northern
Atlantic (1504; fig. 27).</p>

<p>The chart of the world by Juan de la Cosa, the companion of
Columbus, is the earliest extant which depicts the discoveries in
the new world (1500), Nicolaus de Canerio, a Genoese, and the
map which Alberto Cantino caused to be drawn at Lisbon for
Hercules d&rsquo;Este of Ferrara (1502), illustrating in addition the
recent discoveries of the Portuguese in the East. Other cosmographers
of distinction were Pedro Reinel (1504-1542), Nuno
Garcia de Toreno (1520), to whom we are indebted for 21 charts,
illustrating Magellan&rsquo;s voyage, Diogo Ribero (maps of the world
1527, 1529),<a name="fa24a" id="fa24a" href="#ft24a"><span class="sp">24</span></a> Alonzo de Santa Cruz, of Seville, whose <i>Isolario
general</i> includes charts of all parts of the world (1541), John
Rotz or Rut (1542), Sebastian Cabot (1544), as also Nicolas
Desliens, Pierre Desceliers, G. Breton and V. Vallard, all of
Arques, near Dieppe, whose charts were compiled between 1541
and 1554.</p>

<p>Of the many general maps of the world or of particular
countries, a large number illustrate such works as G. Reisch&rsquo;s
<i>Margarita philosophica</i> (1163), the cosmographies of Peter
Apianus or Bienewitz (1520, 1522, 1530), Seb. Münster (1544),
J. Honter (1546) and Gulielmus Postel (1561) or the <i>Geographia</i> of
Livio Sanuto (1588); others, and these the more numerous and
important, supplement the original maps of several editions of
Ptolemy. Thus the Roman edition of 1507, edited by Marcus
Benaventura and Joa Cota, contains 6 modern maps, and to
these was added in 1508 Joh. Ruysch&rsquo;s famous map of the world
on a modified conical projection. The next edition published at
Venice in 1511 contained a heart-shaped world by Bernhard
Sylvanus. The Strassburg Ptolemy of 1513 has a supplement
of as many as 20 modern maps by Martin Waldseemüller or
Ilacomilus, several among which are copied from Portuguese
originals. Waldseemüller was one of the most distinguished
cartographers of his day. He was born at Radolfzell in Baden
in 1470, was associated with Ringmann at the gymnasium of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page645" id="page645"></a>645</span>
St Dié, and died in 1521. He published in 1507 a huge map of the
world, in 12 sheets, together with a small globe of a diameter of
110 mm., the segments for which were printed from wood-blocks.
On these documents the new world is called America, after
Amerigo Vespucci, its supposed discoverer. In 1511 Waldseemüller
published a large map of Europe, in 1513 he prepared his
maps for the Strassburg edition of Ptolemy, and in 1516 he
engraved a copy of Canerio&rsquo;s map of the world. The Strassburg
Ptolemy of 1522 contains Waldseemüller&rsquo;s maps,<a name="fa25a" id="fa25a" href="#ft25a"><span class="sp">25</span></a> edited on a
reduced scale by Laurentius Frisius, together with three additional
ones. The same set of maps is reprinted in the Strassburg
edition of 1524, newly translated by W. Pirckheimer with notes
by Joh. Müller Regiomontanus, and in the Lyon edition of 1535,
edited by Michael Servetus. The new maps of the Basel edition
of 1540, twenty-one in number, are by Sebastian Münster;
Jacob Gastaldo supplied the Venice edition of 1548 with
34 modern maps, and these with a few additions are repeated in
Girolamo Ruscelli&rsquo;s Italian translation of Ptolemy published at
Venice in 1561.</p>

<p>Equally interesting with these Ptolemaic supplements are
collections like that of Anton Lafreri, which contains reprints of
142 maps of all parts of the world originally published between
1556 and 1572 (<i>Geografica tavole moderne</i>, Rome, n.d.), or that
of J. F. Camocio, published at Venice in 1576, which contains
88 reprints.</p>

<p>The number of cartographers throughout Europe was considerable,
and we confine ourselves to mentioning a few leading men.
Among them Germany is then represented by G. Glockedon,
the author of an interesting road-map of central Europe (1501),
Sebastian Münster (1489-1552), Elias Camerarius, whose map
of the mark of Brandenburg won the praise of Mercator; Wolfgang
Latz von Lazius, to whom we are indebted for maps of
Austria and Hungary (1561), and Philip Apianus, who made
a survey of Bavaria (1553-1563), which was published 1568 on
the reduced scale of 1 : 144,000, and is fairly described as the
topographical masterpiece of the 16th century. For maps of
Switzerland we are indebted to Konrad Türst (1495-1497),
Johann Stumpf (1548) and Aegidius Tschudi (1538). A map of
the Netherlands from actual survey was produced by Jacob of
Deventer (1536-1539). Leonardo da Vinci, the famous artist,
while in the service of Cesare Borgia as military engineer, made
surveys of several districts in central Italy. Other Italian cartographers
of merit were Giovanni Battiste Agnese of Venice,
whose atlases (1517-1564) enjoyed a wide popularity; Benedetto
Bordone (1528); Giacomo Gastaldo, cosmographer of the Venetian
Republic (1534-1568), and his successor, Paolo Forlani. New
maps of Spain and Portugal appeared in 1560, the former being
due to Pedro de Medina, the latter to Fernando Alvarez Secco
and Hernando Alvaro. Among the French map-makers of this
period may be mentioned Oronce Finée (Finaeus), who in 1525
published a map of France, and Jean Jolivet (<i>c.</i> 1560). Gregorio
Lilly (1546) and Humphrey Lhuyd of Denbigh (d. 1510)
furnished maps of the British Isles, Olaus Magnus (1539) of
Scandinavia, Anton Wied (1542), Sigismund von Herberstein
(1549) and Anthony Jenkinson (1562) of Muscovy.</p>

<p>The cylindrical and modified conical projections of Marinus
and Ptolemy were still widely used, the stereographical projection
of Hipparchus, was for the first time employed for terrestrial maps
in the 16th century, but new projections were introduced in addition
to these. The earliest of these, a trapeziform projection with
equidistant parallels, by D. Nicolaus Germanus (1466), naturally
led to what is generally known as Flamsteed&rsquo;s projection. Joh.
Stabius (1502) and his pupil J. Werner (1514) devised three
heart-shaped projections, one of which was equivalent. Petrus
Apianus (1524) gave his map an elliptical shape. H. Glareanus
(1510) was the first to employ an equidistant zenithal polar
projection.</p>

<p>No reasonable fault can be found with the marine surveyors
of this period, but the scientific cartographers allowed themselves
too frequently to be influenced by Ptolemaic traditions. Thus
Gastaldo (1548) presents us with a map of Italy, which, except
as to nomenclature, differs but little from that of Ptolemy,
although on the Portolano charts the peninsula had long since
assumed its correct shape. Many of the local maps, too, were
excellent specimens of cartography, but when we follow any
cartographer of the period into regions the successful delineation
of which depended upon an intelligent interpretation of
itineraries, and of information collected by recent travellers, they
are generally found to fail utterly. This is illustrated by the
four sketch maps shown in fig. 28.</p>

<p>Columbus, trusting to Toscanelli&rsquo;s misleading chart, looked
upon the countries discovered by him as belonging to eastern
Asia, a view still shared about 1507 by his brother Bartolomeo.
Waldseemüller (1507) was the first to separate America and Asia
by an ocean of considerable width, but J. Ruysch (1508)
returns to the old idea, and even joins Greenland (Gruenlant)
to eastern Asia. Bologninus Zalterius on a map of 1566,
and Mercator on his famous chart of 1569, separates the two
continents by a narrow strait which they call Streto de Anian,
thus anticipating the discovery of Bering Strait by more than
a hundred and fifty years. Anian, however, which they place
upon the American coast, is no other than Marco Polo&rsquo;s Anica
or Anin, our modern Annam. Such an error could never have
arisen had the old compilers of maps taken the trouble to plan
Marco Polo&rsquo;s routes.</p>

<p><i>Globes</i>, both celestial and terrestrial, became popular after
the discovery of America. They were included among the
scientific apparatus of ships and of educational establishments.
Columbus and Magellan had such globes, those of the latter
produced by P. Reinel (1519), and Conrad Celtes tells us that
he illustrated his lectures at the university of Vienna with
the help of globes (1501). Globes were still engraved on
copper, or painted by hand, but since 1507, in which year
Waldseemüller published a small globe of a diameter of 110 mm.,
covered with printed segments or gores, this cheap and expeditious
method has come into general use. Waldseemüller
constructed his gores graphically, A. Dürer (1525) and Hen.
Loriti Glareanus (1527) were the first who dealt scientifically
with the principles underlying their construction. Globes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page646" id="page646"></a>646</span>
covered with printed gores were produced by L. Boulenger
(1514), Joh. Schöner (1515), P. Apianus, Gemma Frisius (1530)
and G. Mercator (1541). Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s rough map of the
world in 8 segments (<i>c.</i> 1513) seems likewise to have been intended
for a globe. Of J. Schöner we know that he produced
four globes, three printed from segments (1515, 1523, 1533), and
one of larger size (diam. 822 mm.), which is drawn by hand, and is
preserved in the Germanic Museum at Nuremberg. Among
engraved globes, one of the most interesting is that which was
discovered by R. M. Hunt in Paris, and is preserved in the Lenox
Library, New York. Its diameter is only 4<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> in. (127 mm.). The
so-called &ldquo;Nancy globe&rdquo; is of chased silver, richly ornamented,
and formerly served the purpose of a pyx. Its diameter is
160 mm., its date about 1530. About the same date is assigned
to a globe by Robert de Bailly, engraved on copper and gilt
(diam. 440 mm.). Celestial globes were manufactured by
Regiomontanus (d. 1476) at Nuremberg, by Joh. Stöffler (1499),
and by G. Hartmann (1535).</p>

<p><i>Mercator and his Successors.</i>&mdash;Of Gerhard Kremer (1512-1594)
the earliest works are a map of Palestine (1537), a map of the
world on a double heart-shaped projection (1525), and a topographical
map of Flanders based upon his own surveys (1540),
a pair of globes (1541, diam. 120 mm.), and a large map of
Europe which has been praised deservedly for its accuracy (1554).
He is best known by his marine chart (1569) and his atlas. The
projection of the former may have been suggested by a note
by W. Pirkheimer in his edition of Ptolemy (1525). Mercator
constructed it graphically, the mathematical principles underlying
it being first explained by E. Wright (1594). The &ldquo;Atlas&rdquo;
was only published after Mercator&rsquo;s death, in 1595. It only contained
nine maps, but after the plates had been sold to Jodocus
(Jesse) Hondius the number of maps was rapidly increased,
although Mercator&rsquo;s name was retained. Mercator&rsquo;s maps are
carefully engraved on copper. Latin letters are used throughout;
the miniatures of older maps are superseded by symbols,
and in the better-known countries the maps are fairly correct,
but they fail lamentably when we follow their author into
regions&mdash;the successful delineation of which depends upon a
critical combination of imperfect information.</p>

<p>Even before Mercator&rsquo;s death, Antwerp and Amsterdam had
become great centres of cartographic activity, and they maintained
their pre-eminence until the beginning of the 18th
century. Abraham Ortelius (1527-1592), of Antwerp, a man of
culture and enterprise, but not a scientific cartographer, published
the first edition of his <i>Theatrum orbis terrarum</i> in 1570.
It then contained 53 maps, by various authors. By 1595 the
number of maps had increased to 119, including a <i>Parergon</i> or
supplement of 12 maps illustrating ancient history. In 1578
was published the <i>Speculum orbis terrarum</i> of Gerard de Jude
or de Judaeis. Lucas Janszon Waghenaer (Aurigarius) of
Enkhuizen published the first edition of his <i>Spiegel der Zeevaart</i>
(Mariners&rsquo; Mirror) at Leiden in 1585. It was the first collection
of marine maps, lived through many editions, was issued
in several languages and became known as <i>Charettier</i> and
<i>Waggoner</i>. In the same year Adrian Gerritsz published a
valuable <i>Paskaarte</i> of the European Sea. Ten years afterwards,
in 1595, W. Barentszoon published a marine atlas of the Mediterranean,
the major axis of which he reduced to 42 degrees. Jodocus
Hondius has already been referred to as the purchaser of Mercator&rsquo;s
plates. The business founded by him about 1602 was
continued by his sons and his son-in-law, Jan Janszon (Jansonius)
and others. By 1653 this firm had already produced atlases
including 451 charts. Willem Janszon, the father of Hondius&rsquo;s
partner, published a collection of charts (1608), to which he
gave the title of <i>Het Licht der Zeevaart</i> (the seaman&rsquo;s light).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page647" id="page647"></a>647</span>
Another cartographic publishing firm was established at Amsterdam
in 1612 by Willem Janszon Blaeu (1571-1638), a friend of
Tycho Brahe, from 1633 &ldquo;mapmaker&rdquo; of the states-general,
and a man of scientific culture. He was succeeded by his son
Jan (d. 1673) and grandson Cornelius, and before the end of
the century turned out a <i>Zee-Spiegel</i> of 108 charts (1623), an
<i>Atlas novus</i> (<i>Nieuwe Atlas</i>), 1642, enlarged in the course of time
until it consisted of 12 folio volumes containing hundreds of
maps. J. A. Colom in 1633 published a collection of maps under
the quaint title of <i>Vurig Colom der Zeevaert</i> (Fiery Column of
Navigation). Among more recent Dutch map publishers are
Nicolaus Vischer (Piscator), R. Goos, H. Doncker, F. de Wit, and
J. and G. van Keulen, whose atlases were published between
1681 and 1722. These Dutch maps and charts are generally
accompanied by descriptive notes or sailing directions printed
on the back of them. A similar work is the <i>Arcano del mare</i> of
Sir Robert Dudley, duke of Northumberland, the numerous
sheets of which are on Mercator&rsquo;s projection (1631).</p>

<p>In France, in the meantime, an arc of the meridian had been
measured (1669-1670) by Jean Picard, numerous longitudes had
been observed between 1672 and 1680 by the same, and by Phil.
de Lahire (d. 1719), and these were utilized in a <i>Carte de France</i>
&ldquo;as corrected from the observations of the members of the
Academy of Sciences&rdquo; (1666-1699), in a map of the world (1694)
by D. Cassini, as also in <i>Le Neptune François</i> (1693) with
contributions by Pene, D. Cassini and others. These corrected
longitudes were not yet available for the maps produced by
Nicolas Sanson of Abbeville, since 1627. The cartographical
establishment founded by him in that year was carried on after
his death in 1667 by his sons, his son-in-law, P. Duval (d. 1683)
and his grandson Robert du Vaugondy (d. 1766). Among the
cartographers whom he employed were M. Tavernier and
Mariette, and in many instances he mentioned the authors
whose maps he copied. By 1710 the maps published by the
firm numbered 466. Nicolas de Fer, the great rival of Sanson,
and his heirs, are stated to have published as many as 600
maps after 1700.</p>

<p>In no other country of Europe was there at the close of the
16th century a geographical establishment capable of competing
with the Dutch towns or with Sanson, but the number
of those who produced maps, in many instances based upon
original surveys, was large. Germany is thus represented,
among others, by C. Henneberger (map of Prussia, 1576), by
M. Oeder, (survey of Saxony, 1586-1607), A. Rauh (fine hill
features on a map of the environs of Wangen and Lindau, 1617),
W. Schickhardt (survey of Württemberg, 1624-1635), and G. M.
Vischer (map of Austria and Styrai, 1669-1786); Switzerland
by H. C. Gyger (Canton of Zürich, a masterpiece, 1667); Italy
by G. A. Magini (1558-1610), and V. Coronelli, appointed
cosmographer of the Venetian Republic, 1685, and founder of
the Ac. Cosmogr. dei Argonauti, the earliest geographical society,
and Diogo Homem, a Portuguese settled at Venice (1558-1574);
Denmark by J. Mejer of Husum (1650); Sweden by A. Buraeus,
the &ldquo;father of Swedish cartographers&rdquo; (1650-1660); the British
Islands by Ch. Saxton (County Atlas of England and Wales
1575), J. Speed (<i>Theatrum</i> of Great Britain, 1610), Timothy
Pont and Robert Gordon of Strathloch (map of Scotland, 1608),
and A. Moll. A <i>Novus atlas sinensis</i>, based upon Chinese surveys,
was published in 1655 by Martin Martini, S.J., a missionary
recently returned from China. Isaac Voss, in his work <i>De
Nili</i> (1659), published a map of central Africa, in which he
anticipated D&rsquo;Anville by rejecting all the fanciful details
which found a place upon Filippo Pigafetta&rsquo;s map of that
continent.</p>

<p>The first maps illustrating the variation of the compass were
published by Chris. Burrus (d. 1632) and Athanasius Kircher
(<i>Magnes</i>, Rome, 1643), and maps of the ocean and tidal currents
by the latter in his <i>Mundus subterraneus</i> (1665). Edmund
Halley, the astronomer, compiled the first variation chart of
scientific value (1683), as also a chart of the winds (1686).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page648" id="page648"></a>648</span></p>

<p>Globes manufactured for commercial purposes by Blaeu and
others have already been mentioned, but several large globes,
for show rather than for use, were produced in addition to these.
Thus A. Busch, of Limburg (1656-1664), manufactured a globe
for Duke Frederick of Holstein, formerly at Gottorp, but since
1713 at Tsarskoye Zelo. It has a diameter of 11 ft. (3.57 metres)
and is hollow, the inner surface of the shell being covered with
a star map, and the outer surface with a map of the world.
Professor Erh. Weigel (1696) produced a hollow celestial globe
in copper, having a small terrestrial globe in its centre. Its
diameter is 3.25 metres. Lastly there is a pair of giant globes of
artistic design, turned out by V. Coronelli (1623), and intended
as presents to Louis XIV. Their diameter is nearly 5 metres.
A pair of globes of 1592 by Emeric Molineux (diam. 610 mm.) is
now in the Temple Library, and is referred to in Blundeville&rsquo;s
<i>Exercises</i> (1594).</p>

<p><i>The Eighteenth Century.</i>&mdash;It was no mere accident which
enabled France to enjoy a pre-eminence in cartographic work
during the greater part of the 18th century. Not only had
French men of science and scientific travellers done excellent
work as explorers in different parts of the world, but France
could also boast of two men, Guillaume Delisle and J. B.
Bourguignon d&rsquo;Anville, able to utilize in the compilation of
their maps the information they acquired.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<p>Delisle (1675-1726) published 98 maps, and although as works
of art they were inferior to the maps of certain contemporaries,
they were far superior to them in scientific value. On one of
his earliest maps compiled under advice of his father Claude
(1700), he gave the Mediterranean its true longitudinal extension
of 41°. It was Delisle who assumed the meridian of Ferro,
which had been imposed upon French navigators by royal order
(1634), to lie exactly 20° to the west of Paris. The work of
reform was carried further by B. D&rsquo;Anville (1697-1782).
Altogether he published 211 maps, of which 66 are included in
his <i>Atlas général</i> (1737-1780); he swept away the fanciful lakes
from off the face of Africa, thus forcibly bringing home to us
the poverty of our knowledge (fig. 32), delineated the Chinese
Empire in accordance with the map based on the surveys conducted
during the reign of the emperor Kanghi, with the aid
of Jesuit missionaries, and published in 1718; boldly refused to
believe in the existence of an Antarctic continent covering half
the southern hemisphere, and always brought a sound judgment
to bear upon the materials which the ever-increasing number
of travellers placed at his disposal. Among other French works
of importance deserving notice are <i>Le Neptune oriental</i> of
Mannevillette (1745) and more especially the <i>Carte géometrique
de la France</i>, which is based upon surveys carried on (1744-1783)
by César François Cassini de Thury and his son Dominique de
Cassini. It is on a transversal cylindrical (rectangular) projection
devised by Jacques Cassini (d. 1746). The hills are
shown in rough hachures.</p>

<p>England, which had entered upon a career of naval conquest
and scientific exploration, had reason to be proud of
J. F. W. Desbarres, <i>Atlantic Neptune</i> (1774), a North-American
Pilot (1779), which first made known the naval surveys of
J. Cook and of others; and Tho. Jefferys&rsquo;s <i>West Indian</i> and
<i>American Atlases</i> (1775, 1778). James Rennell (1742-1830), who
was surveyor-general of India, published the <i>Bengal Atlas</i> (1781),
and sagaciously arranged the vast mass of information collected
by British travellers and others in India and Africa, but it is
chiefly with the name of Aaron Arrowsmith, who came to London
in 1778, and his successors, with which the glory of the older
school of cartographers is most intimately connected. His
nephew John died in 1873. Among local cartographers may be
mentioned H. Moll (d. 1732), J. Senex, whose atlas was published
in 1725, and Dowet, whose atlas was brought out at the
expense of the duke of Argyll.</p>

<p>In Germany J. B. Homann (d. 1724) founded a geographical
establishment in 1702, which depended at first upon copies of
British and French maps, but in course of time published also
original maps such as J. M. Hase&rsquo;s <i>Africa</i> (1727) and Tobias
Meyer&rsquo;s <i>Mappa critica</i> of Germany (1780), J. T. Güssfeld&rsquo;s map
of Brandenburg (1773), John Majer&rsquo;s Württemburg (1710),
and J. C. Müller&rsquo;s Bavaria, both based on trigonometrical
surveys. Colonel Schmettau&rsquo;s excellent survey of the country
to the west of the Weser (1767-1787) was never published, as
Frederick the Great feared it might prove of use to his military
enemies. Switzerland is represented by J. J. Scheuchzer (1712),
J. Gessner (d. 1790), G. Walser (<i>Atlas novus Helvetiae</i>, 1769),
and W. R. Meyer, <i>Atlas der Schweiz</i> (1786-1802). Of the
Austrian Netherlands, Count Joseph de Ferrari published a
chorographic map on the same scale as Cassini&rsquo;s <i>Carte de la
France</i> (1777). Of Denmark a fine map was published under
the auspices of the Academy of Science of Copenhagen (1766-1825);
of Spain and Portugal an atlas in 102 sheets by Thomas
Lopez (1765-1802); of Russia a map by J. N. Delisle in 19
sheets (1730-1745); charts illustrating the variation of the
compass and of magnetic &ldquo;dip&rdquo; by E. Dunn (1776), J. C.
Wiffe (1768); a chart of the world by W. Dampier (1789).
Map projections were dealt with by two eminent mathematicians,
J. H. Lambert (1772) and Leonh. Euler (1777).</p>

<p>On the maps of Delisle and d&rsquo;Anville the ground is still
represented by &ldquo;molehills.&rdquo; Hachures of a rude nature first
made their appearance on David Vivier&rsquo;s map of the environs
of Paris (1674), and on Cassini&rsquo;s <i>Carte de la France</i>. Contour lines
(isobaths) were introduced for the first time on a chart of the
Merwede by M. S. Cruquius (1728), and on a chart of the
English Channel by Phil. Buache (1737). Dupain-Triel, acting
on a suggestion of Du Carla, compiled a contoured map of France
(1791), and it only needed the introduction of graduated tints
between these contours to secure a graphic picture of the features
of the ground. It was J. G. Lehmann (1783) who based his
method of hill-shading or hachuring upon these horizontal
contours. More than 80 methods of showing the hills have
found advocates since that time, but all methods must be
based upon contours to be scientifically satisfactory.</p>

<p>Two relief maps of Central Switzerland deserve to be mentioned,
the one by R. L. Pfyffer in wax, now in Lucerne, the other by
J. R. Meyer of Aarau and Müller of Engelberg in papier mâché,
now in Zurich. Globes of the usual commercial type were
manufactured in France by Delisle (1700), Forbin (1710-1731),
R. and J. de Vaugondy (1752), Lalande (1771); in England by
E. and G. Adams (1710-1766); Germany by Homann and Seutter
(1750). A hollow celestial globe 18 ft. in diameter was set up
by Dr Roger Long at Cambridge; the terrestrial globe which
Count Ch. Gravie of Vergennes presented to Louis XVI. in
1787 had a diameter of 26 metres, or 85 ft.</p>

<p><i>Modern Cartography.</i>&mdash;The compiler of maps of the present
day enjoys many advantages not enjoyed by men similarly
occupied a hundred years ago. Topographical surveys are
gradually extending, and explorers of recent years are better
trained for their work than they were a generation ago, whilst
technical processes of recent invention&mdash;such as lithography,
photography and heliogravure&mdash;facilitate or expedite the
completion of his task. This task, however, has grown more
difficult and exacting. Mere outline maps, such as formerly
satisfied the public, suffice no longer. He is called upon more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page649" id="page649"></a>649</span>
especially to give a satisfactory delineation of the ground, he
must meet the requirements of various classes of the public,
and be prepared to record cartographically all the facts of
physical or political geography which are capable of being
recorded on his maps. The ingenuity of the compiler is
frequently taxed when called upon to illustrate graphically
the results of statistical information of every description.</p>

<p>Germany since the middle of the 19th century has become the
headquarters of scientific cartography. This is due as much
to the inspiriting teachings of Ritter and Humboldt as to the
general culture and scientific training combined with technical
skill commanded by the men who more especially devote themselves
to this branch of geography, which elsewhere is too
frequently allowed to fall into the hands of mere mechanics.
Men like H. Berghaus (1797-1884), H. Kiepert (1818-1899), and
A. Petermann (1822-1878) must always occupy a foremost place
in the history of cartography. Among the geographical establishments
of Germany, that founded by Justus Perthes (1785), at
Gotha, occupies the highest rank. Among its publications are
A. Stieler&rsquo;s <i>Hand-Atlas</i> (1817-1832), K. von Spruner&rsquo;s <i>Historical
Atlas</i> (1438-1488), H. Berghaus&rsquo; <i>Physical Atlas</i> (1838-1842), E.
von Sydow&rsquo;s <i>Wall Maps for Schools</i> (1838-1840) and <i>School Atlas</i>
(1847). The titles of these atlases survive, though the authors of
the original editions are long dead, and the maps have been
repeatedly superseded by others bringing the information up to
the date of publication. To the same firm we are indebted for
Petermann&rsquo;s <i>Mitteilungen</i>, started in 1855 by A. Petermann,
after whose death in 1902 they were successively edited by
E. Behm, A. Supan and P. Langhans, as also the <i>Geographisches
Jahrbuch</i> (since 1866), at first edited by E. Behm, afterwards by
Professor H. Wagner. Among other geographical institutes in
Germany which deserve mention are the Weimar Institut,
founded in 1791 by F. J. Bertuch, and directed in 1845-1852
by H. Kiepert; Paul Fleming at Glogau (K. Sohr&rsquo;s Handatlas,
1845), A. Ravenstein at Frankfort, D. Reimer at Berlin (H.
Kiepert, <i>Handatlas</i>, 1860); R. Andree (<i>Hand-Atlas</i>, 1880), and E.
Debes (<i>Hand-Atlas</i>, 1894) in Leipzig, and E. Hölzer in Vienna
(Vincenz von Haardt&rsquo;s maps). France is represented by the
publishing firms of Ch. Delagrave (Levaseur&rsquo;s maps), Hachette
(Vivien de St Martin&rsquo;s <i>Atlas universel</i>, in progress since 1875,
F. Schrader&rsquo;s <i>Atlas de géographie moderne</i>, 1880), and Armand
Colin (Vidal de la Blache&rsquo;s <i>Atlas général</i>, 1894). In Great
Britain A. Arrowsmith established himself in London in 1770
(<i>General Atlas</i>, 1817), but the cartographical business ceased on
the death of John Arrowsmith in 1873. John Walker, to whose
initiative the charts published by the admiralty are indebted
for the perspicuous, firm and yet artistic execution, which
facilitate their use by the mariner, was also the author of the
maps published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge
(1820-1840). Among more recent firms are W. and A. K.
Johnston (founded 1825; <i>Royal Atlas</i>, 1855); J. Bartholomew &amp;
Co., now carried on by J. G. Bartholomew (Reduced Survey
maps, <i>Atlas of the World&rsquo;s Commerce</i>, 1906); Philip &amp; Sons
(<i>Imperial Atlas</i>, 1890; <i>Systematic Atlas</i> by E. G. Ravenstein,
1894; <i>Mercantile Marine Atlas</i>, 1904, globes), and E. Stanford
(<i>London Atlas</i>).</p>

<p>In 1890 Professor A. Penck proposed to prepare a map of the
world, including the oceans, on a scale of 1 : 1,000,000, and his
scheme was promised the support of a committee which met in
London in 1909, and upon which were represented the leading
powers of the world. Maps on that scale of a great part of
Africa, Asia and America have been published by British,
French, German and United States authorities. A bathymetrical
chart of the oceans, by Professor J. Thoulet was
published in 1904 at the expense of Prince Albert of Monaco.</p>

<p>Reliefs from printed maps were first produced by Bauerkeller
of Darmstadt and Dondorf at Frankfort, from originals furnished
by A. Ravenstein (1838-1844). The exaggeration in altitude,
on these maps and on those of a later date and on a larger scale,
was very considerable. No such exaggeration exists in the case
of reliefs of parts of the Alps, on a large scale, by P. Keil and
Pelikan (1890), X. Imfeld (1891), P. Oberlerchner (1891-1895),
C. Perron (1893-1900), F. Becker (1900), A. Heim (1904) and
others. A relief globe was first suggested in a letter of
M. Maestlin to J. Kepler (1596). The first globe of this description
for the use of the blind, was made by A. Zeune in 1810.
H. Erben is the author of a rough relief on a convex surface
(1842), but the finest example of this description is a relief of
Italy, by César Pomba and H. Fritsche, on a scale of 1 : 1,000,000
and without exaggeration of heights (1880-1884). A map of Italy
in the baptistery of St Peter at Rome has occasionally been
described as a relief, though it is merely a rude outline map of
Italy, by Carlo Fontana (1698), carved into a convex surface.</p>

<p>Several globes of unusual dimensions were produced in the
course of last century. That which Colonel Langlois erected
in the Champs Elysées (1824) had a diameter of 39 metres. James
Wyld&rsquo;s hollow globe, or &ldquo;Georama,&rdquo; diam. 18 metres, occupied
Leicester Square until swept away as a nuisance. The giant
globe proposed by Elisée Reclus in 1895 has never been erected;
he has, however, produced maps on a concave surface, as
suggested by J. D. Hauber in 1742.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities.</span>&mdash;The history of maps is dealt with ably in Vivien
de Saint Martin&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de la géographie</i> (Paris, 1875), and in
Peschel&rsquo;s <i>Geschichte der Erdkunde</i> (2nd ed. by Sophus Ruge, Berlin,
1877), as also by W. Wollkenhauer (<i>Leitfaden zur Geschichte der
Kartographie</i>, Breslau, 1895), and H. Zondervan (<i>Allgemeine Kartenkunde</i>,
Leipzig, 1901). J. Lelewel&rsquo;s <i>Geographie du moyen âge</i>, with
an atlas (Brussels, 1850-1857), has in part been superseded by
more recent researches. There are, however, a number of works,
beautifully illustrated, which deal fully with particular periods of
the subject. Among these may be mentioned Konrad Miller&rsquo;s
<i>Die ältesten Weltkarten</i> (Stuttgart, 1895-1897), which only deals
with maps not influenced by the ideas of Ptolemy. The contents of
the following collections are more varied in their nature, viz. E. F.
Jomard&rsquo;s <i>Monuments de la géographie</i> (Paris, 1862), Santarem&rsquo;s
<i>Atlas composé de mappemondes et de portulans</i>, &amp;c. (Paris, 1842-1853,
78 plates). A. E. Nordenskiöld&rsquo;s <i>Facsimile Atlas</i> (Stockholm, 1889),
Gabriel Marcell, <i>Choix de cartes et de mappemondes XIV<span class="sp">e</span> et XV<span class="sp">e</span>

XVIth and XVIIth Centuries reproduced in their Original Size</i> (Amsterdam,
1894-1897), and <i>Bibliotheca lindesiana</i> (London, 1898) with
facsimiles of the Harleian and other Dieppese maps of the 16th
century. Nautical charts are dealt with in A. E. Nordenskiöld&rsquo;s
<i>Periplus</i> (Stockholm, 1869), and Th. Fischer&rsquo;s <i>Sammlung mittelälterlicher
Welt- und Seekarten</i> (Vienna, 1886). The discovery and
mapping of America are illustrated by F. Kunstmann&rsquo;s <i>Entdeckung
Amerikas</i> (Munich, 1859), K. Kretschmer&rsquo;s <i>Atlas zur Entdeckung
Amerikas</i> (Berlin, 1892), G. Marcel&rsquo;s <i>Reproductions de cartes et de

early Discovery and Exploration of America, 1502-1530</i> (New Brunswick,
N.J., 1906). In addition to these collections, numerous
single maps have been published in geographical periodicals or
separately. See also V. Hantzsch and L. Schmidt, <i>Kartog. Denkmäler
zur Entdeckungsgeschichte von Amerika, Asien, Australien und
Afrika aus der k. Bibliothek zu Dresden</i> (Leipzig, 1903), and the

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Topographical Surveys.</i></p>

<p>The year 1784 marks the beginning of the ordnance survey,
for in that year Major-General Roy measured a base line of
27,404 ft. on Hounslow Heath. Six additional base
lines were measured up to 1849, including the Lough
<span class="sidenote">United Kingdom.</span>
Foyle, in 1827-1828, and that on Salisbury Plain, in
1849. The primary triangulation was only completed in 1858,
but in the meantime, in 1791, the detail survey had begun. At
first it was merely intended to produce a map sufficiently accurate
on a scale of 1 in. to a mile (1 : 63,360). Ireland having been
surveyed (1824-1842) on a scale of 6 in. to a mile (1 : 10,560),
it was determined in 1840, after the whole of England and Wales,
with the exception of Lancashire and Yorkshire, had been
completed on one-inch scales, to adopt that scale for the whole
of the United Kingdom. Finally, in 1854, a cadastral survey of
the whole of the United Kingdom, only excepting uncultivated
districts, was resolved upon, on a scale of 1 : 2500, still larger
scales (1 : 500 or 1 : 1000) being adopted for town plans. Parish
boundaries are laid down with the help of local meresmen
appointed by justices at quarter sessions. The horizontal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page650" id="page650"></a>650</span>
contours are based upon instrumental measurement, and as a
whole these ordnance maps were undoubtedly superior in accuracy,
with rare exceptions, to similar maps published by foreign
governments. Even though the hill hachures on the older
one-inch maps are not quite satisfactory, this deficiency is in a
large measure compensated for by the presence of absolutely
trustworthy contours. Originally the maps were engraved on
copper, and the progress of publication was slow; but since the
introduction of modern processes, such as electrotyping (in
1840), photography (in 1855) and zincography (in 1859), it has
been rapid. A plan, the engraving of which formerly took two
years, can now be produced in two days.</p>

<p>The one-inch map for the whole of the United Kingdom was
completed in 1890. It covers 697 sheets (or 488 of a &ldquo;new
series&rdquo; in large sheets), and is published in three editions, viz.
(<i>a</i>) in outline, with contours in black, (<i>b</i>) with hills hachured in
brown or black, and (<i>c</i>) printed in five colours. Carefully revised
editions of these and of the other maps are brought out at
intervals of 15 years at most. Since 1898 the department has
also published maps on a smaller scale, viz. a map of England
and Wales, on a scale of 2 m. to 1 in., in two editions, both
printed in colour, the one with hills stippled in brown, the
other coloured on the &ldquo;layer system&rdquo; as a strata-relief map; a
map of the United Kingdom on a scale of 4 m. to 1 in., also
in two editions, the one in outline, showing five classes of
roads and parish boundaries, the other in colours, with stippled
hills; a map on a scale of 10 m. to 1 in., also in two editions,
and finally a map of the United Kingdom on a scale of
1 : 1,000,000.</p>

<p>The geological surveys of Great Britain and Ireland were connected
from 1832 to 1853 with the ordnance survey, but are
now carried on independently. The ordnance survey, too, no
longer depends on the war office but upon the board of
agriculture and fisheries. A <i>Bathymetrical Survey of the Freshwater
Lochs of Scotland</i>, under the direction of Sir John Murray
and L. Pullar, was completed in 1908, and the results published
by the Royal Geographical Society.</p>

<p>Proposals for a new map of France, to replace the famous
Cassini map of 1744-1793 were made in 1802 and again by
R. Bonne in 1808, but owing to the wars then devastating
Europe no steps were taken until 1817, and
<span class="sidenote">France.</span>
the <i>Carte de France de l&rsquo;état major</i> on a scale of 1 : 80,000 was
only completed in 1880. It is engraved on copper. The hachured
hills are based upon contours, and are of admirable commensurability.
It has served as a basis for a <i>Carte de la France</i>,
published by the Service Vicinal on a scale of 1 : 100,000, in
596 sheets, and of a general map prepared by the ministère des
travaux publics on a scale of 1 : 200,000 in 80 sheets. On both
these maps the hills are printed in grey chalk. A third topographical
map of France is being published in accordance with
the recommendation of a committee presided over by General
de la Noix in 1897. The surveys for this map were begun in
1905. The maps are based upon the cadastral plans (1 : 1000),
thoroughly revised and connected with the triangulation of
France and furnished with contours at intervals of 5 m. by
precise measurement. These <i>minutes</i> are published on a scale
of 1 : 10,000 or 1 : 20,000 for mountain districts, while the scale
of the general map is 1 : 50,000. Each sheet is bounded by
parallels and meridians. The hills are shown in brown contours
at intervals of 10 m. and grey shading in chalk (Berthaut, <i>La
Carte de France, 1750-1898</i>; Paris, 1899). A geological map of
France on a scale of 1 : 80,000 is nearly completed, there are also
a map (1 : 500,000) by Carez and Vasseur, and an official <i>Carte
géologique</i> (1 : 1,000,000; 1906).</p>

<p>By the middle of the 19th century topographical maps of the
various German states had been completed, and in several
instances surveys of a more exact nature had been
completed or begun, when in 1878 the governments of
<span class="sidenote">Germany.</span>
Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria and Württemberg agreed to supersede
local maps by publishing a map of the empire (<i>Reichskarte</i>) in
674 sheets on a scale of 1 : 100,000. The earlier sheets of this
excellent map were lithographed, but these are gradually being
superseded by maps engraved on copper. Colour-printing is
employed since 1901. The hills are hachured and in some
instances contours at intervals of 50 metres are introduced. The
map was completed in 1909, but is continually undergoing
renewal. The <i>Messtischblätter</i>, called <i>Positionsblätter</i> in Bavaria,
are on a scale of 1 : 25,000. The older among them leave
much to be desired, but those of a later date are satisfactory.
This applies more especially to the maps of Saxony (since 1879)
and Württemberg (since 1893). The features of the ground on
most of these maps are shown by contours at intervals of
10 metres. The map produced on this large scale numbers over
5000 sheets, and is used as a basis for the geological surveys
carried on in several of the states of Germany. A general
map of the German Empire (<i>Uebersichtskarte</i>) on a scale of
1 : 200,000, in 196 sheets, is in progress since 1893. It is
printed in three colours, and gives contours at intervals of 10
metres. In addition to these maps there are D. G. Reymann&rsquo;s
well-known <i>Specialkarte von Mittel Europa</i> (1 : 200,000),
acquired by the Prussian government in 1874 (it will ultimately
consist of 796 sheets), a government and Liebenow&rsquo;s
map of central Europe (1 : 300,000) and C. Vogel&rsquo;s beautiful
map of Germany (1 : 500,000).</p>

<p>The <i>Specialkarte</i> of Austria-Hungary on a scale of 1 : 75,000
(765 sheets), based upon a triangulation and cadastral surveys
(1816-1867), was completed in 1889, and published in
heliogravure. This map was repeatedly revised,
<span class="sidenote">Austria-Hungary.</span>
but as it no longer met modern requirements as to
accuracy the director of the military geographical establishment
at Vienna, Field Marshal Chr. von Steeb, in 1896, organized
what practically amounts to a re-survey of the entire monarchy,
to be completed in 75 years. At the same time the cadastral
plans, reduced to a scale of 1 : 25,000, are being published in
photo-lithography. A general map of central Europe in 283
sheets published by the Austrian government (1 : 200,000)
includes nearly the whole of the Balkan Peninsula.</p>

<p>The famous map of Switzerland, with which is associated the
name of General H. Dufour (d. 1875), is based upon a triangulation
(1809-1833) and surveys on a scale of 1 : 25,000
for the lowlands, 1 : 50,000 for the alpine districts, and
<span class="sidenote">Switzerland.</span>
was published (1842-1865) on a scale of 1 : 100,000.
The hills are hachured, the light, in the case of the loftier regions,
being supposed to fall obliquely. The original surveys, carefully
revised, have been published since 1870 as a <i>Topographical
Atlas of Switzerland</i>&mdash;the so-called <i>Siegfried Atlas</i>, in 552 sheets.
They are printed in three colours, contours at intervals of 10 and
20 metres being in brown, incidental features (ravines, cliffs,
glaciers) in black or blue. To mountain-climbers these contour
maps are invaluable, but for ordinary purposes &ldquo;strata maps,&rdquo;
such as J. M. Ziegler&rsquo;s hypsometric maps (1856) or so-called
&ldquo;relief maps,&rdquo; which attempt to delineate the ground so as to
give the impression of a relief, are generally preferred.</p>

<p>The new survey of Belgium was completed in 1872 and there
have been published 527 plane-table sections or <i>planchettes</i> on
<span class="sidenote">Belgium.</span>
a scale of 1 : 20,000 (1866-1880), a &ldquo;Carte topographique
de la Belgique,&rdquo; in 72 sheets, on a scale of
1 : 40,000 (1861-1883), and a more recent map in 26 sheets
on a scale of 1 : 100,000 (1903-1912). The last is printed in five
colours, the ground is shown in contours of 10 metres interval
and grey stippling.</p>

<p>The new survey of the Netherlands, based upon General
Krayenhoff&rsquo;s primary triangulation (1802-1811) was completed
<span class="sidenote">Holland.</span>
in 1855. The results have been published on a
scale of 1 : 25,000 (776 sheets, since 1866), 1 : 50,000
(Topographic and Military Map, 62 sheets, 1850-1864, and a
Waterstaatskaart, 1864-1892), and 1 : 200,000 (Topographical
Atlas, 21 sheets, 1868-1871).</p>

<p>In Denmark, on the proposal of the Academy of Science,
a survey was carried out in 1766-1825, but the maps issued
by the Danish general staff depend upon more
<span class="sidenote">Denmark.</span>
recent surveys. These include plane-table sections
(<i>Maalebordsblade</i>), 1209 sheets on a scale of 1 : 20,000, with contours
at intervals of 5 to 10 ft., published since 1830; <i>Atlasblade</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page651" id="page651"></a>651</span>
of Jutland and of <i>De Danske Öer</i>, on a scale of 1 : 40,000, the
former in 131 sheets, since 1870, the latter, on the same scale,
in 94 sheets, since 1890, and still in progress, and a general
staff map on a scale of 1 : 100,000, in 68 sheets, since 1890.
Maps of the Faroer and of Iceland have likewise been issued.</p>

<p>Modern surveys in Sweden date from the organization of a
corps of &ldquo;Landemätare,&rdquo; known since 1874 as a topographical
department of the general staff. The maps issued
<span class="sidenote">Scandinavia.</span>
by this authority include one of southern Sweden,
1 : 100,000, another of northern Sweden, 1 : 200,000, and a general
map on a scale of 1 : 1,000,000. In Norway a geographical
survey (<i>Opmaaling</i>) has been in progress since 1783, but the
topographical map of the kingdom on a scale of 1 : 100,000 in
340 sheets, has not yet been completed.</p>

<p>Of Russia in Europe only the more densely peopled governments
have been surveyed, since 1816, in the manner of other
European countries, while for most regions there
are only so-called &ldquo;military surveys.&rdquo; The most
<span class="sidenote">Russia.</span>
readily available map of the whole country is the 10-verst
map (1 : 420,000), known as General J. A. Strelbitzki&rsquo;s,
and published 1865-1880. A topographic map (1 : 126,000)
embracing the whole of western Russia, with Poland and the
country of the Don Cossacks, is designed to be extended
over the whole empire. Certain governments&mdash;Moscow, Kief,
Volhynia, Bessarabia, the Crimea, &amp;c.&mdash;have been published
on a scale of 1 : 24,000, while Finland, as far as 61° N., was
re-surveyed in 1870-1895, and a map on a scale of 1 : 42,000
is approaching completion.</p>

<p>Surveys in Asiatic Russia are conducted by the topographical
departments organized at Orenburg, Tashkent, Omsk, Irkutsk
and Tiflis. To the latter we are indebted for a valuable map
of Caucasia, 1 : 210,000, which since the first publication (1863-1885)
has undergone careful revision. The Siberian departments
have published a number of maps on a scale of 1 : 420,000. In
addition to these the survey for the Trans-Siberian railway has
been published on a scale of 1 : 630,000, as also maps of the
Russo-Chinese frontier districts, 1 : 210,000 and 1 : 1,168,000.
A map of Asiatic Russia, 1 : 420,000, by Bolshef, in 192 sheets,
is in course of publication.</p>

<p>Passing to southern Europe we find that Portugal has completed
a <i>Charta chorographica</i> (1 : 100,000) since 1856. In
<span class="sidenote">Portugal and Spain.</span>
Spain a plane-table survey on a scale of 1 : 20,000
has been in progress since 1870, but of the map of
Spain in 1078 sheets on a scale of 1 : 50,000 only
150 had been issued by the depósito de la guerra up to 1910.
Meanwhile reference may be made to B. F. Coello&rsquo;s <i>Atlas de la
España</i> (1848-1890), the maps of which are on a scale of
1 : 200,000.</p>

<p>In Italy <i>Tavulette rilevata</i> on a scale of 1 : 25,000 or 1 : 50,000,
<span class="sidenote">Italy.</span>
with contours, based on surveys made 1862-1890, are being
published, and a <i>Carta del regno d&rsquo;Italia</i>, 1 : 100,000,
is practically complete. There are a <i>Carta idrologica</i>
and a <i>Carta geologica</i> on the same scale, and a <i>Carta orografica</i>
on a scale of 1 : 500,000.</p>

<p>Greece is still dependent upon foreigners for its maps, among
which the <i>Carte de Grèce</i> (1 : 200,000) from rapid surveys made
by General Palet in 1828, was published in a new
edition in 1880. A similar map, mainly based upon
<span class="sidenote">Greece.</span>
surveys made by Austrian officers and revised by H. Kiepert
(1 : 300,000), was published by the Military Geographical
Institute of Vienna in 1885. Far superior to these maps is
the <i>Karte von Attika</i> (1 : 100,000 and 1 : 25,000) based upon
careful surveys made by Prussian officers and published by
E. Curtius and J. H. Kaupert on behalf of the German Archaeological
Institute in Athens (1878), or A. Philippson&rsquo;s map of
the Peloponnese (1 : 300,000; 1901).</p>

<p>For maps of the Balkan Peninsula we are still largely indebted
to the rapid surveys carried on by Austrian and Russian
officers. The Austrian map of central Europe
embraces the whole of the Balkan Peninsula on a scale
<span class="sidenote">Balkan States.</span>
of 1 : 200,000; the Russian surveys (1877-1879) are
embodied in a map of the eastern part of the Balkan on a scale
1 : 126,000, and a map of Bulgaria and southern Rumelia, on a
scale 1 : 200,000, both published in 1883. A map of Turkey in
Europe, scale 1 : 210,000, was published by the Turkish general
staff (1899), and another map, scale 1 : 250,000, by the intelligence
division of the British war office is in progress since
1906. Bosnia and Herzegovina are now included with the
surveys of the Austrian Empire, the kingdom of Servia has
been surveyed (1880-1891) and the results published on a
scale of 1 : 75,000; in eastern Rumania surveys have been in
progress since 1874 and the results have been published on a
scale of 1 : 50,000; a general map of the entire kingdom, scale
1 : 200,000, was published in 1906-1907; a map of Montenegro
(1 : 75,000), based on surveys by Austrian and Russian
officers, was published at Vienna in 1894.</p>

<p>In Asiatic Turkey several districts of historical interest
have been surveyed, and surveys have likewise been made in
the interest of railways, or by boundary commissions,
but there is no such thing as a general survey
<span class="sidenote">Asia.</span>
carried on under the direction of government. We are thus,
to a large extent, still dependent upon compilations, such as
R. Kiepert&rsquo;s <i>Asia Minor</i> (1 : 400,000; 1904-1908), a map of
eastern Turkey in Asia, Syria and western Persia (1 : 2,000,000;
1910), published by the Royal Geographical Society, or a
Russian general map (1 : 630,000, published 1880-1885).
Among maps based upon actual surveys those of Palestine,
by Lieutenant G. R. Conder and H. H. (afterwards Lord)
Kitchener (1 : 63,360, 1880), of the Sinai Peninsula by Sir
C. W. Wilson and H. S. Palmer (1 : 126,730, 1870), of Arabia
Petraea by Dr A. Musil (1 : 300,000, 1907) or of the Aden territory
(1905) are among the more interesting. Of Cyprus an excellent
map from surveys by Major (Lord) H. H. Kitchener was
published in 1884 (1 : 63,360).</p>

<p>In the case of Persia and Afghanistan we are still dependent
upon compilations such as a Russian staff map (1 : 840,000,
published in 1886), Colonel Sir T. H. Holdich&rsquo;s map of
Persia (1 : 1,014,000, Simla, 1897-1899), or a smaller map
(1 : 2,028,000 and 1 : 4,056,000), published by the geographical
division of the general staff. The settlement of boundaries
in northern Afghanistan (1883) and in Seistan (1870) has
necessitated surveys of some interest.</p>

<p>A trigonometrical survey of British India was begun in 1800
and the country can now boast of a survey which in most respects
is equal to those of most European states. The surveys are
made on scales varying according to the necessities of the
case or the nature of the country, and they have been extended
since 1862 beyond the boundaries of India proper. Revenue
surveys for land settlement are published on a scale of 1 : 4000,
but the usual scale for topographical maps is 1 : 63,360. An
<i>Indian Atlas</i>, on a scale of 1 : 255,660, includes also Ceylon and the
Malay Peninsula, but although begun so long ago as 1827 many
of its sheets are unpublished. There are in addition an official
map of India (1 : 1,000,000), the first edition of which was
published in 1903, as also maps of the great provinces of India,
including Burma, all on a scale of 1 : 2,827,520, and a variety
of physical and statistical maps. Ceylon and the Straits
Settlements, with the Federal Malay States, have their own
surveyors-general. The British North Borneo Company published
a <i>Map of British North Borneo</i>, on a scale of 1 : 633,600
(1905).</p>

<p>In Siam a regular survey was organized by Mr J. McCarthy
(1881-1883), a former official of the Indian survey, which did
good work in connexion with the determination of the Franco-Siamese
frontier (1906). The surveys are made on the scales
of 1 : 4000, 1 : 31,680 and 1 : 63,360.</p>

<p>In French Indo-China surveys have been in progress since
1881. The Bureau of the Indo-Chinese general staff, has
published a map of Indo-China, including Cambodia, in 45
sheets (1 : 200,000, 1895), while to the service géographique de
l&rsquo;Indo-Chine, organized in 1899, we owe a <i>Carte de l&rsquo;Indo-Chine</i>
(1 : 500,000).</p>

<p>For China we are still largely dependent upon careful compilations
like Baron F. von Richthofen&rsquo;s <i>Atlas von China</i> (1 : 750,000,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page652" id="page652"></a>652</span>
Berlin, 1885-1890) or Bretschneider&rsquo;s <i>Map of China</i> (1 : 4,600,000)
a new edition of which appeared at St Petersburg in 1900.
There are good survey maps of the British colony of Hong-Kong,
of Wei-hai-Wei and of the country around Kiao-chou, and the
establishment of topographical offices at Peking and Ngan-king
holds out some promise of native surveys. In the meantime
large scale maps prepared by European authorities are to be
welcomed, such as maps of Chih-li and Shan-tung (1 : 200,000),
from surveys by Prussian officers, 1901-1905, maps on East
China (1 : 1,000,000) and of Yun-nan by British, German
and Indian officers, of the Indo-Chinese frontier (1 : 200,000,
Paris 1908), and of the upper Yangtsze-kiang by S. Chevalier
(Shanghai, 1900).</p>

<p>Japan has a regular survey department originated by
Europeans and successfully carried on by natives. The primary
triangulation was completed in 1880, a topographical map
coloured geologically (1 : 200,000) was published 1889-1897, and
in addition to this there are being published an agronomical
map on a scale of 1 : 100,000 (since 1887) and others. The
Japanese government has likewise published a map of Korea
(1 : 1,000,000; 1898).</p>

<p>The Philippine Islands are represented in a carefully compiled
map by C. W. Hodgson (1 : 1,115,000, New York, 1908). Of
Java we possess an excellent topographical map based upon
surveys made 1850-1887 (1 : 100,000). A similar map has been
in progress for Sumatra since 1883, while the maps for the
remaining Dutch Indies are still based, almost exclusively, upon
flying surveys. For general purposes the <i>Atlas der Nederlandsche
Bezittingen in Oost-Indie</i> by J. N. Stemfoort and J. J. Ten
Siethoff, of which a new edition has been published since 1900,
may be consulted with confidence.</p>

<p>In Africa nearly all the international boundaries have been
carefully surveyed and marked on the ground, since 1880, and
yield a good basis as a guide for the map compiler.
A general map of Africa, by Colonel Lannoy de
<span class="sidenote">Africa.</span>
Bissy, on a scale of 1 : 2,000,000 was first published in 1882-1888,
but is carefully revised from time to time. The geographical
section of the British general staff is publishing maps
of all Africa on scales of 1 : 250,000 and 1 : 1,000,000. In
Egypt excellent work has been done by a survey department
organized and directed by Captain H. G. Lyons up to 1909.
It has published a topographical map of the Nile valley
(1 : 50,000), an irrigation map (1 : 100,000), a general map
(1 : 250,000), numerous cadastral plans, &amp;c. Work on similar
lines is carried on in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Algeria has
been in course of survey since 1868, Tunis since 1878, and the
results have been published on scales of 1 : 50,000 and 1 : 250,000.
Of Morocco there are many maps, among which several compiled
by the French service géographique de l&rsquo;armée, including a
<i>Carte du Maroc</i> (1 : 200,000), in progress since 1909. In the
British colonies of tropical and of South Africa<a name="fa26a" id="fa26a" href="#ft26a"><span class="sp">26</span></a> surveys for
the most part are carried on actively. Of the Gambia Colony
there is a map by Major E. L. Cowie (1 : 250,000, 1904-1905);
the survey of the Gold Coast Colony is being published by
Major F. G. Guggisberg since 1907 (1 : 125,000 and 1 : 200,000);
southern and northern Nigeria are adequately represented
on the maps of the general staff (1 : 250,000). The states of
British South Africa have each their surveyor-general, and a
reconnaissance survey has been in progress since 1903. It is
based upon a careful triangulation, superintended by Sir D.
Gill, and carried in 1907 within 70 m. of Lake Tanganyika.
This survey is rapidly superseding other maps, such as the
surveyor-general&rsquo;s map of Cape Colony (1 : 127,000); A. Duncan&rsquo;s
map of the Orange River State (1 : 148,705; 1902-1904) and
Jeppe&rsquo;s map of the Transvaal (1 : 476,000; 1899). The results
of a survey of southern Rhodesia are given on the map of the
British general staff (1 : 500,000; 1909), while of north-eastern
Rhodesia we have an excellent map compiled by C. L. Beringer
in 1907 (1 : 1,000,000). Surveys in British Central Africa were
taken up in 1894; a survey of Lake Nyasa, by Lieut. E. L.
Rhoades and W. B. Phillips, was published in 1902. As regards
British East Africa and Uganda, the surveys in the latter (on
scales of 1 : 10,000 and 1 : 125,000) have made considerable
progress. The Victoria Nyanza was surveyed by Captain B.
Whitehouse (1898-1900), and the results have been published
on a scale of 1 : 292,000. These British possessions, together
with the whole of Somaliland and southern Abyssinia, are
satisfactorily represented on the maps of the British general
staff.</p>

<p>Maps of the French Africa Colonies have been published by
the service géographique de l&rsquo;Afrique occidental and the
service géographique des colonies. A map of Senegal
(1 : 100,000) is in progress since 1905. The official maps of
the other colonies have been compiled by A. Meunier between
1902 and 1909. They include French West Africa, (1 : 2,000,000;
2nd ed., 1908), French Guinea (1 : 500,000; 1902) and the Ivory
Coast and Dahomey (1 : 1,500,000; 1907-1908). A map of the
French Congo by J. Hansen (1 : 1,500,000), was published in
1907. In Madagascar a topographical bureau was established
by General J. S. Gallieni in 1896, and the surveys are being
published since 1900 on a scale of 1 : 100,000.</p>

<p>As regards the German colonies we are dependent upon
compilations by R. Kiepert, P. Sprigade and M. Moisel. Good
maps of the Portuguese colonies are to be found in an <i>Atlas
colonial Portugues</i>, a second edition of which was published by
the Commissão de Cartographia in 1909. Of the Congo State
we have an official map on a scale of 1 : 1,000,000, published
in 1907. Of Italian Eritrea we have excellent maps on various
scales of 1 : 100,000, 1 : 200,000 and 1 : 500,000, based upon
surveys made between 1888 and 1900.</p>

<p>In the states of Australia cadastral surveys conducted by
surveyors-general have been in progress for many years, as also
trigonometrical surveys (Western Australia excepted),
and the publication of parish and township or county
<span class="sidenote">Australia.</span>
maps keeps pace with the settlement of the country; but with
the exception of Victoria none of these states is in possession
of a topographical map equal in accuracy to similar maps
published in Europe. In Victoria the so-called geodetic survey
was begun in 1858; the maps are published on a scale of
1 : 126,730. There exists also a general map, on a scale of
1 : 506,930. Maps on the same scale are available of New
South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania, on a scale of
1 : 560,000 for Western Australia, on a scale of 1 : 253,460 for
Queensland. There are likewise maps on smaller scales, which
undergo frequent revision. The map of British New Guinea
is on a scale of 1 : 330,200 (1898). New Zealand has a good
general map on a scale of 1 : 633,700. A trigonometrical
survey was given up and only details of immediate practical
use are required. The &ldquo;Lands Department&rdquo; of the Fiji Islands
has published a map on a scale of 1 : 380,000 (1908).</p>

<p>The cadastral surveys in Canada are carried on by a commission
of Crown-lands in the old provinces and by a Dominion
land office, which lays out townships as in the United
States, but with greater accuracy. A surveyor-general
<span class="sidenote">North America.</span>
is attached to the department of the interior,
at Ottawa. He publishes the topographical maps (1 : 63,366)
since 1906. They are based upon theodolite traverses 15 m.
apart, and connected with the United States lake and coast
surveys, the details being filled in by plane-table surveys on a
scale of 1 : 31,680. The contours, 25 ft. apart, depend upon
spirit-levelling. In the Rocky Mountains surveys photographic
apparatus is successfully employed. The surveyor-general
issues also &ldquo;sectional maps&rdquo; (1 : 190,000 and 1 : 40,000) and
so-called &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; topographical maps for the thinly peopled
west, on scales of 1 : 250,000 and 1 : 500,000. He is responsible
likewise for maps of Yukon and of Labrador, supplied by the
geological survey, the former on a scale of 1 : 380,200, the
latter of 1 : 1,584,000. The intelligence branch of the Canadian
department of military defence is publishing since 1904 topographical
maps on scales of 1 : 63,366 and 1 : 126,730, with
contours. A geodetic survey department, under Dr. W. F. King,
chief astronomer of the Dominion, was established in 1909.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page653" id="page653"></a>653</span></p>

<p>Maps of Newfoundland, orographical as well as geological,
scale 1 : 1,584,200, have been published.</p>

<p>In the United States a &ldquo;geological survey&rdquo; was organized
in 1879, under Clarence King as director, whose successor,
Major J. W. Powell, rightly conceived that it was necessary to
produce good topographical maps before a geological survey
could be pursued with advantage. It is under his wise guidance
that the survey has attained its present efficiency. It is based
upon a triangulation by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.
The maps of the more densely peopled parts of the Union are
published on a scale of 1 : 62,500, and those of the remainder
of the country on half or a quarter of that scale. The hills
are shown by contours at intervals of 10 or 100 ft. The details
given are considered sufficient to admit of the selection of
general routes for railways or other public works. The survey
progresses at the rate of about 40,000 sq. m. annually, and in
course of time it will supersede the map of the separate states,
based on older surveys. A &ldquo;reconnaissance&rdquo; map of Alaska
(on a scale of 1 : 250,000) was published in 1908.</p>

<p>In Mexico the surveys are in charge of a comision geografica-exploradora
attached to the secretaria de Fomento, but only
about 140 sheets of a <i>Carta general</i> on a scale of
<span class="sidenote">Central America.</span>
1 : 100,000 have been published. There are also a
map of the state of S. Luis Potosi (1 : 250,000), of
the environs of Puebla (1 : 50,000) and a <i>Carta general de la
republica mexicana</i> (1 : 250,000).</p>

<p>A useful map of Central America has been published by the
topographical section of the British general staff on a scale
of 1 : 170,300. Of great value for cartographical work is a
careful survey, carried out by American engineers (1897-1898),
for a continental railway running along the west coast from
Mexico to Chile. In South America, in proportion to the area
of the country, only few surveys of a thoroughly scientific nature
have been made, and it is therefore satisfactory that the service
géographique of the French army should be publishing, since
1900, a map of the entire continent on a scale of 1 : 1,000,000.</p>

<p>Colombia is but inadequately represented by rough maps.
For Colombia we have F. L. Vergara y Velasco&rsquo;s <i>Atlas de
geografia colombiana</i> (1906-1908); Ecuador is fairly well represented
by Th. Wolf (1892) and Hans Meier (1907); in the case
of Peru we still largely depend upon Paz Soldan&rsquo;s <i>Atlas geografica</i>
(1865-1867) and A. Raimondi&rsquo;s <i>Mapa del Peru</i> (1 : 500,000)
based upon surveys made before 1869. Sir Martin Conway&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Map of the Andes of La Paz&rdquo; (1 : 600,000; 1900) as well
as Major P. H. Fawcett&rsquo;s survey of the Brazilian boundary
(1906-1907) are welcome additions to our knowledge of Bolivia.
In Chile a comision <span class="correction" title="amended from topografico">topografica</span> was appointed as long
ago as 1848, but the map produced under its auspices by
Professor F. Pissis (1 : 250,000, 1870-1877), leaves much to be
desired. Since that time, however, valuable maps have been
published by an <i>Oficina de mensura de tierras</i>, by a <i>seccion de
geografia y minas</i> connected with the department of public
works, by the <i>Oficina hidrografica</i>, and more especially in connexion
with surveys necessitated by the boundary disputes with
Argentina, which were settled by arbitration in 1899 and 1902.
The surveys which led to the latter were conducted by Sir
Thomas Holdich.</p>

<p>In Venezuela a commission for producing a <i>plano militar</i> or
military map of the country was appointed by General Castro
in 1904, but little progress seems to have been made, and meantime
we are dependent upon a revised edition of A. Codazzi&rsquo;s map
of 1840 which was published in 1884. In Brazil little or nothing
is done by the central government, but the progressive states
of São Paulo and Mines Gerães have commissãos geographicos
e geologicos engaged in the production of topographical maps.
Valuable materials have likewise been acquired by several river
surveys including those of the Amazonas by Azevedo and Pinto
(1862-1864) and W. Chandless (1862-1869) and of the Rio
Madeira by Colonel G. Earl Church and Keller-Leuzinger
(1860-1875). The proposal of a committee presided over by
the Marshal H. de Beaurepaire-Rohan (1876) to prepare a map
of Brazil on a scale of 1 : 200,000 has never been acted upon,
and in the meantime we are dependent upon works like the
<i>Atlas do imperio do Brazil</i> by Mendes de Almeida (1868) or
the maps in our general atlases.</p>

<p>In Argentina an official geographical institute was established
in 1879, but neither A. Seelstrang&rsquo;s <i>Atlas</i> (1886-1892) nor
H. Hoskold&rsquo;s <i>Mapa topografica</i> (1 : 2,000,000; London, 1895),
which were published by it, nor any of the numerous provincial
maps are based upon scientific surveys.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It need hardly be said that hydrographic surveys have been of
great service to compilers of maps. There are few coast-lines,
frequented by shipping, which have not yet been surveyed in a
definite manner. In this work the British hydrographic office
may justly claim the credit of having contributed the chief share.
Great Britain has likewise taken the lead in those deep-sea explorations
which reveal to us the configuration of the sea-bottom, and
enable us to construct charts of the ocean bed corresponding to the
contoured maps of dry land yielded by topographical surveys.</p>

<p>In the construction of maps, one has to consider how a portion
of spherical surface, or a configuration traced on a sphere, can
be represented on a plane. If the area to be represented bear
a very small ratio to the whole surface of the sphere, the matter
is easy: thus, for instance, there is no difficulty in making a
map of a parish, for in such cases the curvature of the surface
does not make itself evident. If the district is larger and reaches
the size of a county, as Yorkshire for instance, then the curvature
begins to be sensible, and one requires to consider how it is to
be dealt with. The sphere cannot be opened out into a plane
like the cone or cylinder; consequently in a plane representation
of configurations on a sphere it is impossible to retain the desired
proportions of lines or areas or equality of angles. But though
one cannot fulfil all the requirements of the case, we may fulfil
some by sacrificing others; we may, for instance, have in the
representation exact similarity to all very small portions of the
original, but at the expense of the areas, which will be quite
misrepresented. Or we may retain equality of areas if we give
up the idea of similarity. It is therefore usual, excepting in
special cases, to steer a middle course, and, by making compromises,
endeavour to obtain a representation which shall not
involve large errors of scale.</p>

<p>A globe gives a perfect representation of the surface of the
earth; but, practically, the necessary limits to its size make it
impossible to represent in this manner the details of countries.
A globe of the ordinary dimensions serves scarcely any other
purpose than to convey a clear conception of the earth&rsquo;s surface
as a whole, exhibiting the figure, extent, position and general
features of the continents and islands, with the intervening
oceans and seas; and for this purpose it is indeed absolutely
essential and cannot be replaced by any kind of map.</p>

<p>The construction of a map virtually resolves itself into the
drawing of two sets of lines, one set to represent meridians, the
other to represent parallels. These being drawn, the filling in
of the outlines of countries presents no difficulty. The first and
most natural idea that occurs to one as to the manner of drawing
the circles of latitude and longitude is to draw them according
to the laws of perspective. Perhaps the next idea which would
occur would be to derive the meridians and parallels in some
other simple geometrical way.</p>

<p><i>Cylindrical Equal Area Projection.</i>&mdash;Let us suppose a model
of the earth to be enveloped by a cylinder in such a way that the
cylinder touches the equator, and let the plane of each parallel
such as PR be prolonged to intersect the
cylinder in the circle pr. Now unroll
the cylinder and the projection will
appear as in fig. 2. The whole world is
now represented as a rectangle, each
parallel is a straight line, and its total
length is the same as that of the
equator, the distance of each parallel
from the equator is sin l (where l is the
latitude and the radius of the model
earth is taken as unity). The meridians are parallel straight
lines spaced at equal distances.</p>

<p>This projection possesses an important property. From the
elementary geometry of sphere and cylinder it is clear that each
strip of the projection is <i>equal in area</i> to the zone on the model
which it represents, and that each portion of a strip is equal in
area to the corresponding portion of a zone. Thus, each
small four-sided figure (on the model) bounded by meridians
and parallels <img style="width:47px; height:52px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img654b.jpg" alt="" /> is represented on the projection by a
rectangle <img style="width:50px; height:27px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img654c.jpg" alt="" /> which is of exactly the same area, and this
applies to any such figure however small. It therefore follows
that any figure, of any shape on the model, is correctly
represented as regards area by its corresponding figure on
the projection. Projections having this property are said to
be <i>equal-area projections</i> or <i>equivalent projections</i>; the
name of the projection just described is &ldquo;the cylindrical
equal-area projection.&rdquo; This projection will serve to exemplify
the remark made in the first paragraph that it is
possible to select certain qualities of the model which shall
be represented truthfully, but only at the expense of other
qualities. For instance, it is clear that in this case all meridian
lengths are too small and all lengths along the parallels, except
the equator, are too large. Thus although the areas are preserved
the shapes are, especially away from the equator, much
distorted.</p>

<p>The property of preserving areas is, however, a valuable one
when the purpose of the map is to exhibit areas. If, for example,
it is desired to give an idea of the area and distribution of the
various states comprising the British Empire, this is a fairly
good projection. Mercator&rsquo;s, which is commonly used in atlases,
preserves local shape at the expense of area, and is valueless for
the purpose of showing areas.</p>

<p>Many other projections can be and have been devised, which
depend for their construction on a purely geometrical relationship
between the imaginary model and the plane. Thus projections
may be drawn which are derived from cones which touch
or cut the sphere, the parallels being formed by the intersection
with the cones of planes parallel to the equator, or by lines drawn
radially from the centre. It is convenient to describe all projections
which are derived from the model by a simple and direct
geometrical construction as &ldquo;geometrical projections.&rdquo; All
other projections may be known as &ldquo;non-geometrical projections.&rdquo;
Geometrical projections, which include perspective
projections, are generally speaking of small practical value.
They have loomed much more largely on the map-maker&rsquo;s
horizon than their importance warrants. It is not going too far
to say that the expression &ldquo;map projection&rdquo; conveys to most
well-informed persons the notion of a geometrical projection;
and yet by far the greater number of useful projections are non-geometrical.
The notion referred to is no doubt due to the very
term &ldquo;projection,&rdquo; which unfortunately appears to indicate an
arrangement of the terrestrial parallels and meridians which
can be arrived at by direct geometrical construction. Especially
has harm been caused by this idea when dealing with the group
of conical projections. The most useful conical projections have
nothing to do with the secant cones, but are simply projections
in which the meridians are straight lines which converge to a
point which is the centre of the circular parallels. The number
of really useful geometrical projections may be said to be four:
the <i>equal-area cylindrical</i> just described, and the following perspective
projections&mdash;the <i>central</i>, the <i>stereographic</i> and <i>Clarke&rsquo;s
external</i>.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Perspective Projections.</i></p>

<p>In perspective drawings of the sphere, the plane on which the
representation is actually made may generally be any plane
perpendicular to the line joining the centre of the sphere and the
point of vision. If V be the point of vision, P any point on the
spherical surface, then p, the point in which the straight line VP
intersects the plane of the representation, is the projection
of P.</p>

<p><i>Orthographic Projection.</i>&mdash;In this projection the point of vision
is at an infinite distance and the rays consequently parallel; in
this case the plane of the drawing may be supposed to pass
through the centre of the sphere. Let the
circle (fig. 3) represent the plane of the
equator on which we propose to make an
orthographic representation of meridians
and parallels. The centre of this circle
is clearly the projection of the pole, and
the parallels are projected into circles
having the pole for a common centre.
The diameters aa&prime;, bb&prime; being at right
angles, let the semicircle bab&prime; be divided
into the required number of equal parts;
the diameters drawn through these points are the projections of
meridians. The distances of c, of d and of e from the diameter
aa&prime; are the radii of the successive circles representing the parallels.
It is clear that, when the points of division are very close, the
parallels will be very much crowded towards the outside of the
map; so much so, that this projection is not much used.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For an orthographic projection of the globe on a meridian plane
let qnrs (fig. 4) be the meridian, ns the axis of rotation, then qr is
the projection of the equator. The parallels will be represented
by straight lines passing through the points of equal division; these
lines are, like the equator, perpendicular to ns. The meridians will
in this case be ellipses described on ns as a common major axis, the
distances of c, of d and of e from ns being the minor semiaxes.</p>

<p>Set off the angle aop (fig. 5) from the radius oa, equal to the latitude.
Drop the perpendicular pP on oa, then P is the projection of the pole.
On ao produced take ob = pP, then ob is the minor semiaxis of the
ellipse representing the equator, its major axis being qr at right angles
to ao. The points in which the meridians meet this elliptic equator
are determined by lines drawn parallel to aob through the points of
equal subdivision cdefgh. Take two points, as d and g, which are
90° apart, and let ik be their projections on the equator; then i
is the pole of the meridian which passes through k. This meridian
is of course an ellipse, and is described with reference to i exactly
as the equator was described with reference to P. Produce io to l,
and make lo equal to half the shortest chord that can be drawn
through i; then lo is the
semiaxis of the elliptic
meridian, and the major
axis is the diameter perpendicular
to iol.</p>

<p>For the parallels: let
it be required to describe
the parallel whose co-latitude
is u; take pm =
pn = u, and let m&prime;n&prime; be
the projections of m and
n on oPa; then m&prime;n&prime; is the
minor axis of the ellipse
representing the parallel.
Its centre is of course midway
between m&prime; and n&prime;, and
the greater axis is equal to
mn. Thus the construction
is obvious. When pm is
less than pa the whole of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page655" id="page655"></a>655</span>
the ellipse is to be drawn. When pm is greater than pa the
ellipse touches the circle in two points; these points divide the
ellipse into two parts, one of which, being on the other side of
the meridian plane aqr, is invisible. Fig. 6 shows the complete
orthographic projection.</p>

<p><i>Stereographic Projection.</i>&mdash;In this case the point of vision is
on the surface, and the projection is
made on the plane of the great circle
whose pole is V. Let kplV (fig. 7) be a
great circle through the point of vision,
and ors the trace of the plane of projection.
Let c be the centre of a small
circle whose radius is cp = cl; the straight
line pl represents this small circle in
orthographic projection.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>We have first to show that the stereographic projection of the small
circle pl is itself a circle; that is to say, a straight line through V,
moving along the circumference of pl, traces a circle on the plane
of projection ors. This line generates an oblique cone standing on a
circular base, its axis being cV (since the angle pVc = angle cVl); this
cone is divided symmetrically by the plane of the great circle kpl, and
also by the plane which passes through the axis Vc, perpendicular to
the plane kpl. Now Vr·Vp, being = Vo sec kVp·Vk cos kVp = Vo·Vk,
is equal to Vs·Vl; therefore the triangles Vrs, Vlp are similar, and it
follows that the section of the cone by the plane rs is similar to the
section by the plane pl. But the latter is a circle, hence also the
projection is a circle; and since the representation of every infinitely
small circle on the surface is itself a circle, it follows that in this
projection the representation of small parts is strictly similar.
Another inference is that the angle in which two lines on the sphere
intersect is represented by the same angle in the projection. This
may otherwise be proved by means of fig. 8, where Vok is the diameter
of the sphere passing through the
point of vision, fgh the plane of
projection, kt a great circle, passing
of course through V, and ouv the
line of intersection of these two
planes. A tangent plane to the
surface at t cuts the plane of projection
in the line rvs perpendicular
to ov; tv is a tangent to the circle kt
at t, tr and ts are any two tangents
to the surface at t. Now the angle
vtu (u being the projection of t) is
90° &minus; otV = 90° &minus; oVt = ouV = tuv,
therefore tv is equal to uv; and
since tvs and uvs are right angles,
it follows that the angles vts and vus are equal. Hence the angle rts
also is equal to its projection rus; that is, any angle formed by two
intersecting lines on the surface is truly represented in the stereographic
projection.</p>
</div>

<p>In this projection, therefore, angles are correctly represented
and every small triangle is represented by a similar triangle.
Projections having this property of similar representation of
small parts are called <i>orthomorphic</i>, <i>conform</i> or <i>conformable</i>.
The word orthomorphic, which was introduced by Germain<a name="fa27a" id="fa27a" href="#ft27a"><span class="sp">27</span></a> and
adopted by Craig,<a name="fa28a" id="fa28a" href="#ft28a"><span class="sp">28</span></a> is perhaps the best to use.</p>

<p>Since in orthomorphic projections very small figures are correctly
represented, it follows that the scale is the same in all
directions round a point in its immediate neighbourhood, and
orthomorphic projections may be defined as possessing this
property. There are many other orthomorphic projections,
of which the best known is Mercator&rsquo;s. These are described
below.</p>

<p>We have seen that the stereographic projection of any circle
of the sphere is itself a circle. But in the case in which the circle
to be projected passes through V, the projection becomes, for a
great circle, a line through the centre of the sphere; otherwise,
a line anywhere. It follows that meridians and parallels are
represented in a projection on the horizon of any place by two
systems of orthogonally cutting circles, one system passing
through two fixed points, namely, the poles; and the projected
meridians as they pass through the poles show the proper differences
of longitude.</p>

<p><i>Central or Gnomonic</i> (<i>Perspective</i>) <i>Projection.</i>&mdash;In this projection
the eye is imagined to be at the centre of the sphere. It is
evident that, since the planes of all great circles of the sphere
pass through the centre, the representations of all great circles
on this projection will be straight lines, and this is the special
property of the <i>central projection</i>, that any great circle (<i>i.e.</i>
shortest line on the spherical surface) is represented by a straight
line. The plane of projection may be either parallel to the plane
of the equator, in which case the parallels are represented by
concentric circles and the meridians
by straight lines radiating
from the common centre; or
the plane of projection may be
parallel to the plane of some
meridian, in which case the
meridians are parallel straight
lines and the parallels are
hyperbolas; or the plane of
projection may be inclined to
the axis of the sphere at any angle &lambda;.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the latter case, which is the most general, if &theta; is the angle any
meridian makes (on paper) with the central meridian, &alpha; the longitude
of any point P with reference to the central meridian, l the latitude
of P, then it is clear that the central meridian is a straight line at
right angles to the equator, which is also a straight line, also
tan &theta; = sin &lambda; tan &alpha;, and the distance of p, the projection of P, from
the equator along its meridian is (on paper) m sec &alpha; sin l / sin (l + x),
where tan x = cot &lambda; cos &alpha;, and m is a constant which defines the scale.</p>
</div>

<p>The three varieties of the central projection are, as is the case
with other perspective projections, known as polar, meridian
or horizontal, according to the inclination of the plane of projection.</p>

<p>Fig. 14 is an example of a <i>meridian central projection</i> of part
of the Atlantic Ocean. The term &ldquo;gnomonic&rdquo; was applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page657" id="page657"></a>657</span>
to this projection because the projection of the meridians is a
similar problem to that of the graduation of a sun-dial. It is,
however, better to use the
term &ldquo;central,&rdquo; which
explains itself. The central
projection is useful
for the study of direct
routes by sea and land.
The United States Hydrographic
Department has
published some charts on
this projection. False
notions of the direction
of shortest lines, which
are engendered by a study
of maps on Mercator&rsquo;s
projection, may be corrected
by an inspection
of maps drawn on the
central projection.</p>

<p>There is no projection
which accurately possesses
the property of showing
shortest paths by straight
lines when applied to the
spheroid; one which very
nearly does so is that which results from the intersection of
terrestrial normals with a plane.</p>

<p>We have briefly reviewed the most important projections
which are derived from the sphere by direct geometrical construction,
and we pass to that more important branch of the subject
which deals with projections which are not subject to this
limitation.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Conical Projections.</i></p>

<p>Conical projections are those in which the parallels are represented
by concentric circles and the meridians by equally spaced
radii. There is no necessary connexion between a conical projection
and any touching or secant cone. Projections for instance
which are derived by geometrical construction from secant cones
are very poor projections, exhibiting large errors, and they will
not be discussed. The name conical is given to the group
embraced by the above definition, because, as is obvious, a
projection so drawn can be bent round to form a cone. The
simplest and, at the same time, one of the most useful forms of
conical projection is the following:</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: left; width: 210px;" summary="Illustration">

<p><i>Conical Projection with Rectified Meridians and Two Standard
Parallels.</i>&mdash;In some books this has been, most unfortunately,
termed the &ldquo;secant conical,&rdquo; on account of the fact that there
are two parallels of the correct length.
The use of this term in the past has
caused much confusion. Two selected
parallels are represented by concentric circular
arcs of their true lengths; the
meridians are their radii. The degrees
along the meridians are represented by
their true lengths; and the other parallels
are circular arcs through points so determined
and are concentric with the chosen
parallels.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Thus in fig. 15 two parallels Gn and G&prime;n&prime; are represented by their
true lengths on the sphere; all the distances along the meridian
PGG&prime;, pnn&prime; are the true spherical lengths rectified.</p>

<p>Let &gamma; be the co-latitude of Gn; &gamma;&prime; that of Gn&prime;; &omega; be the true difference
of longitude of PGG&prime; and pnn&prime;; h&omega; be the angle at O; and OP
= z, where Pp is the representation of the pole. Then the true length
of parallel Gn on the sphere is &omega; sin &gamma;, and this is equal to the length
on the projection, <i>i.e.</i> &omega; sin &gamma; = h&omega; (z + &gamma;); similarly &omega; sin &gamma;&prime; = h&omega; (z + &gamma;&prime;).</p>

<p>The radius of the sphere is assumed to be unity, and z and &gamma; are
expressed in circular measure. Hence h = sin &gamma;/(z + &gamma;) =
sin &gamma;&prime; (z + &gamma;&prime;); from this h and z are easily found.</p>
</div>

<p>In the above description it has been assumed that the two
errorless parallels have been <i>selected</i>. But it is usually desirable
to impose some condition which itself will fix the errorless
parallels. There are many conditions, any one of which may
be imposed. In fig. 15 let Cm and C&prime;m&prime; represent the extreme
parallels of the map, and let the co-latitudes of these parallels
be c and c&prime;, then any one of the following conditions may be
fulfilled:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The errors of scale of the extreme parallels may be made
equal and may be equated to the error of scale of the parallel
of maximum error (which is near the mean parallel).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Or the errors of scale of the extreme parallels may be
equated to that of the mean parallel. This is not so good a
projection as (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Or the absolute errors of the extreme and mean parallels
may be equated.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Or in the last the parallel of maximum error may be
considered instead of the mean parallel.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Or the mean length of all the parallels may be made correct.
This is equivalent to making the total area between the extreme
parallels correct, and must be combined with another condition,
for example, that the errors of scale on the extreme parallels
shall be equal.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>We will now discuss (<i>a</i>) above, viz. a conical projection with rectified
meridians and two standard parallels, the scale errors of the
extreme parallels and parallel of maximum error being equated.</p>

<p>Since the scale errors of the extreme parallels are to be equal,</p>

<p class="center">h = (z + &gamma;) / sin &gamma; = (z + &gamma;&prime;) / sin &gamma;&prime;.</p>

<p>If this is applied to the case of a map of South Africa between the
limits 15° S. and 35° S. (see fig. 16) it will be found that the parallel
of maximum error is 25° 20&prime;; the errorless parallels, to the nearest
degree, are those of 18° and 32°. The greatest scale error in this
case is about 0.7%.</p>

<p>In the above account the earth has been treated as a sphere.
Of course its real shape is approximately a spheroid of revolution,
and the values of the axes most commonly employed are those of
Clarke or of Bessel. For the spheroid, formulae arrived at by the
same principles but more cumbrous in shape must be used. But it
will usually be sufficient for the selection of the errorless parallels
to use the simple spherical formulae given above; then, having made
the selection of these parallels, the true spheroidal lengths along the
meridians between them can be taken out of the ordinary tables
(such as those published by the Ordnance Survey or by the U.S.
Coast and Geodetic Survey). Thus, if a<span class="su">1</span>, a<span class="su">2</span>, are the lengths of 1°
of the errorless parallels (taken from the tables), d the true rectified
length of the meridian arc between them (taken from the tables),</p>

<p class="center">h = { (a<span class="su">2</span> &minus; a<span class="su">1</span>) / d} 180 / &pi;,</p>

<p class="noind">and the radius on paper of parallel, a<span class="su">1</span> is a<span class="su">1</span>d/(a<span class="su">2</span> &minus; a<span class="su">1</span>), and the radius
of any other parallel = radius of a<span class="su">1</span> ± the true meridian distance
between the parallels.</p>

<p>This class of projection was used for the 1/1,000,000 Ordnance
map of the British Isles. The three maximum scale errors in this
case work out to 0.23%, the range of the projection being from
50° N. to 61° N., and the errorless parallels are 59° 31&prime; and 51°44&prime;.</p>

<p>Where no great refinement is required it will be sufficient to take
the errorless parallels as those distant from the extreme parallels
about one-sixth of the total range in latitude. Thus suppose it is
required to plot a projection for India between latitudes 8° and 40° N.
By this rough rule the errorless parallels should be distant from the
extreme parallels about 32°/6, <i>i.e.</i> 5° 20&prime;; they should therefore,
to the nearest degree, be 13° and 35° N. The maximum scale
errors will be about 2%.</p>

<p>The scale errors vary approximately as the square of the range of
latitude; a rough rule is, largest scale error = L<span class="sp">2</span>/50,000, where L is
the range in the latitude in degrees. Thus a country with a range
of 7° in latitude (nearly 500 m.) can be plotted on this projection
with a maximum linear scale error (along a parallel) of about 0.1%;<a name="fa29a" id="fa29a" href="#ft29a"><span class="sp">29</span></a>
there is no error along any meridian. It is immaterial with this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page658" id="page658"></a>658</span>
projection (or with any conical projection) what the extent in longitude
is. It is clear that this class of projection is accurate, simple
and useful.</p>

<p>In the projections designated by (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) above, absolute errors
of length are considered in the place of errors of scale, <i>i.e.</i> between
any two meridians (<i>c</i>) the absolute errors of length of the extreme
parallels are equated to the absolute error of length of the middle
parallel. Using the same notation</p>

<p class="noind">L. Euler, in the <i>Acta Acad. Imp. Petrop.</i> (1778), first discussed this
projection.</p>

<p>If a map of Asia between parallels 10° N. and 70° N. is constructed
on this system, we have c = 20°, c&prime; = 80°, whence from the above
equations z = 66.7° and h = .6138. The absolute errors of length
along parallels 10°, 40° and 70° between any two meridians are equal
but the scale errors are respectively 5, 6.7, and 15%.</p>

<p>The modification (<i>d</i>) of this projection was selected for the
1 : 1,000,000 map of <i>India and Adjacent Countries</i> under publication
by the Survey of India. An account of this is given in a pamphlet
produced by that department in 1903. The limiting parallels
are 8° and 40° N., and the parallel of greatest error is 23° 40&prime; 51&Prime;.
The errors of scale are 1.8, 2.3, and 1.9%.</p>

<p>It is not as a rule desirable to select this form of the projection.
If the surface of the map is everywhere equally valuable it is clear
that an arrangement by which errors of scale are larger towards
the pole than towards the equator is unsound, and it is to be noted
that in the case quoted the great bulk of the land is in the north of
the map. Projection (<i>a</i>) would for the same region have three equal
maximum scale errors of 2%. It may be admitted that the practical
difference between the two forms is in this case insignificant,
but linear scale errors should be reduced as much as possible in
maps intended for general use.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> In the fifth form of the projection, the total area of the projection
between the extreme parallels and any two meridians is
equated to the area of the portion of the sphere which it represents,
and the errors of scale of the extreme parallels are equated. Then
it is easy to show that</p>

</table>

<p>It can also be shown that any other zone of the same range in
latitude will have the same scale errors along its limiting parallels.
For instance, a series of projections may be constructed for zones,
each having a range of 10° of latitude, from the equator to the pole.
Treating the earth as a sphere and using the above formulae, the
series will possess the following properties: the meridians will all be
true to scale, the area of each zone will be correct, the scale errors
of the limiting parallels will all be the same, so that the length of
the upper parallel of any zone will be equal to that of the lower
parallel of the zone above it. But the curvatures of these parallels
will be different, and two adjacent zones will not fit but will be
capable of exact rolling contact. Thus a very instructive flat model
of the globe may be constructed which will show by suitably arranging
the points of contact of the zones the paths of great circles on the
sphere. The flat model was devised by Professor J. D. Everett,
F.R.S., who also pointed out that the projection had the property of
the equality of scale errors of the limiting parallels for zones of the
same width. The projection may be termed <i>Everett&rsquo;s Projection</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Simple Conical Projection.</i>&mdash;If in the last group of projections
the two selected parallels which are to be errorless approach each
other indefinitely closely, we get a projection in which all the
meridians are, as before, of the true rectified lengths, in which
one parallel is errorless, the curvature of that parallel being
clearly that which would result from the unrolling of a cone
touching the sphere along the parallel represented. And it was
in fact originally by a consideration of the tangent cone that the
whole group of conical projections came into being. The
quasi-geometrical
way of regarding conical projections is legitimate in
this instance.</p>

<table class="flt" style="float: right; width: 200px;" summary="Illustration">

<div class="condensed">
<p>The simple conical projection is therefore arrived at in this way:
imagine a cone to touch the sphere along any selected parallel, the
radius of this parallel on paper (Pp, fig. 17)
will be r cot &phi;, where r is the radius of the
sphere and &phi; is the latitude; or if the spheroidal
shape is taken into account, the radius of the
parallel on paper will be &nu; cot &phi; where &nu; is
the normal terminated by the minor axis (the
value &nu; can be found from ordinary geodetic
tables). The meridians are generators of the
cone and every parallel such as HH&prime; is a circle,
concentric with the selected parallel Pp and
distant from it the true rectified length of the
meridian arc between them.</p>

<p>This projection has no merits as compared
with the group just described. The errors of
scale along the parallels increase rapidly as the selected parallel is
departed from, the parallels on paper being always too large. As
an example we may take the case of a map of South Africa of the
same range as that of the example given in (<i>a</i>) above, viz. from
15° S. to 35° S. Let the selected parallel be 25° S.; the radius of
this parallel on paper (taking the radius of the sphere as unity) is
cot 25°; the radius of parallel 35° S. = radius of 25° &minus; meridian
distance between 25° and 35° = cot 25° &minus; 10&pi;/180 = 1.970. Also

<p><i>Bonne&rsquo;s Projection.</i>&mdash;This projection, which is also called the
&ldquo;modified conical projection,&rdquo; is derived from the simple conical,
just described, in the following way: a central meridian
is chosen and drawn as a straight line; degrees of latitude
spaced at the true rectified distances are marked along this line;
the parallels are concentric circular arcs drawn through the
proper points on the central meridian, the centre of the arcs
being fixed by describing one chosen parallel with a radius of
&nu; cot &phi; as before; the meridians on each side of the central
meridian are drawn as follows: along <i>each</i> parallel distances are
marked equal to the true lengths along the parallels on sphere
or spheroid, and the curve through corresponding points so fixed
are the meridians (fig. 18).</p>

<p>This system is that which was adopted in 1803 by the &ldquo;Dépôt
de la Guerre&rdquo; for the map of France, and is there known by
the title of <i>Projection de Bonne</i>. It is
that on which the ordnance survey map of
Scotland on the scale of 1 in. to a mile is
constructed, and it is frequently met with
in ordinary atlases. It is ill-adapted for
countries having great extent in longitude,
as the intersections of the meridians and
parallels become very oblique&mdash;as will be
seen on examining the map of Asia in most atlases.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>If &phi;<span class="su">0</span> be taken as the latitude of the centre parallel, and co-ordinates
be measured from the intersection of this parallel with the central
meridian, then, if &rho; be the radius of the parallel of latitude &phi;, we
have &rho; = cot &phi;<span class="su">0</span> + &phi;<span class="su">0</span> &minus; &phi;. Also, if S be a point on this parallel whose
co-ordinates are x, y, so that VS = &rho;, and &theta; be the angle VS makes
with the central meridian, then &rho;&theta; = &omega; cos &phi;; and x = &rho; sin &theta;, y =
cot &phi;<span class="su">0</span> &minus; &rho; cos &theta;.</p>
</div>

<p>The projection has the property of equal areas, since each
small element bounded by two infinitely close parallels is equal
in length and width to the corresponding element on the sphere
or spheroid. Also all the meridians cross the chosen parallel
(but no other) at right angles, since in the immediate neighbourhood
of that parallel the projection is identical with the simple
conical projection. Where an equal-area projection is required
for a country having no great extent in longitude, such as

Projection.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Sinusoidal Equal-area Projection.</i>&mdash;This projection, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page659" id="page659"></a>659</span>
sometimes known as Sanson&rsquo;s, and is also sometimes incorrectly
called Flamsteed&rsquo;s, is a particular case of Bonne&rsquo;s in which the
selected parallel is the equator. The equator is a straight line
at right angles to the central meridian which is also a straight
line. Along the central
meridian the latitudes are
marked off at the true
rectified distances, and
from points so found the
parallels are drawn as
straight lines parallel to
the equator, and therefore
at right angles to the
central meridian. True
rectified lengths are
marked along the parallels
and through corresponding
points the meridians
are drawn. If the earth
is treated as a sphere the
meridians are clearly sine
curves, and for this reason
d&rsquo;Avezac has given the
projection the name sinusoidal. But it is equally easy to plot
the spheroidal lengths. It is a very suitable projection for an
equal-area map of Africa.</p>

<p><i>Werner&rsquo;s Projection.</i>&mdash;This is another limiting case of Bonne&rsquo;s
equal-area projection in which the selected parallel is the pole.
The parallels on paper then become incomplete circular arcs of
which the pole is the centre. The central meridian is still a
straight line which is cut by the parallels at true distances.
The projection (after Johann Werner, 1468-1528), though
interesting, is practically useless.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Polyconic Projections.</i></p>

<p>These pseudo-conical projections are valuable not so much
for their intrinsic merits as for the fact that they lend themselves
to tabulation. There are two forms, the <i>simple</i> or <i>equidistant
polyconic</i>, and the <i>rectangular polyconic</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Simple Polyconic.</i>&mdash;If a cone touches the sphere or
spheroid along a parallel of latitude &phi; and is then unrolled, the
parallel will on paper have a radius of &nu; cot &phi;, where &nu; is the
normal terminated by the minor axis. If we imagine a series
of cones, each of which touches one of a selected series of
parallels, the apex of each cone will lie on the prolonged axis
of the spheroid; the generators of each cone lie in meridian
planes, and if each cone is unrolled and the generators in any
one plane are superposed to form a straight central meridian,
we obtain a projection in which the central meridian is a
straight line and the parallels are circular arcs each of which
has a different centre which lies on the prolongation of the
central meridian, the radius of any parallel being &nu; cot &phi;.</p>

<p>So far the construction is the same for both forms of polyconic.
In the <i>simple polyconic</i> the meridians are obtained by measuring
outwards from the central meridian along each parallel the true
lengths of the degrees of longitude. Through corresponding
points so found the meridian curves are drawn. The resulting
projection is accurate near the central meridian, but as this is
departed from the parallels increasingly separate from each
other, and the parallels and meridians (except along the equator)
intersect at angles which increasingly differ from a right angle.
The real merit of the projection is that each particular parallel
has for every map the same absolute radius, and it is thus easy
to construct tables which shall be of universal use. This is
especially valuable for the projection of single sheets on comparatively
large scales. A sheet of a degree square on a scale of
1 : 250,000 projected in this manner differs inappreciably from
the same sheet projected on a better system, <i>e.g.</i> an orthomorphic
conical projection or the conical with rectified meridians and two
standard parallels; there is thus the advantage that the simple
polyconic when used for single sheets and large scales is a
sufficiently close approximation to the better forms of conical
projection. The simple polyconic is used by the topographical
section of the general staff, by the United States coast and
geodetic survey and by the topographical division of the U.S.
geological survey. Useful tables, based on Clarke&rsquo;s spheroid
of 1866, have been published by the war office and by the
U.S. coast and geodetic survey.</p>

<p>Fig. 22 is a representation of this
system of the continents of Europe
and Africa, for which it is well
suited. For Asia this system
would not do, as in the northern
latitudes, say along the parallel of
70°, the representation is much
cramped.</p>

<p>With regard to the distortion in
the map of Africa as thus constructed,
consider a small square
in latitude 40° and in 40° longitude
east or west of the central
meridian, the square being so placed
as to be transformed into a
rectangle. The sides, originally
unity, became 0.95 and 1.13, and
the area 1.08, the diagonals intersecting
at 90° ± 9° 56&prime;. In Clarke&rsquo;s perspective projection a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page660" id="page660"></a>660</span>
square of unit side occupying the same position, when transformed
to a rectangle, has its sides 1.02 and 1.15, its area 1.17,
and its diagonals intersect at 90° ± 7° 6&prime;. The latter projection
is therefore the best in point of &ldquo;similarity,&rdquo; but the former
represents areas best. This applies, however, only to a particular
part of the map; along the equator towards 30° or 40°
longitude, the polyconic is certainly inferior, while along the
meridian it is better than the perspective&mdash;except, of course,
near the centre. Upon the whole the more even distribution
of distortion gives the advantage to the perspective system.
For single sheets on large scales there is nothing to choose
between this projection and the simple polyconic. Both are
sensibly perfect representations. The rectangular polyconic
is occasionally used by the topographical section of the general
staff.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Zenithal Projections.</i></p>

<p>Some point on the earth is selected as the central point of the
map; great circles radiating from this point are represented
by straight lines which are inclined at their true angles at the
point of intersection. Distances along the radiating lines vary
according to any law outwards from the centre. It follows (on
the spherical assumption), that circles of which the selected point
is the centre are also circles on the projection. It is obvious that
all perspective projections are zenithal.</p>

<p><i>Equidistant Zenithal Projection.</i>&mdash;In this projection, which is
commonly called the &ldquo;equidistant projection,&rdquo; any point on
the sphere being taken as the centre of the map, great circles
through this point are represented by straight lines of the true
rectified lengths, and intersect each other at the true angles.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the general case&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">if z<span class="su">1</span> is the co-latitude of the centre of the map, z the co-latitude of
any other point, &alpha; the difference of longitude of the two points,
A the azimuth of the line joining them, and c the spherical length
of the line joining them, then the position of the intersection of
any meridian with any parallel is given (on the spherical assumption)
by the solution of a simple spherical triangle.</p>

<p>Thus&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">let tan &theta; = tan z cos &alpha;, then cos c = cos z sec &theta; cos (z &minus; &theta;), and
sin A = sin z sin &alpha; cosec c.</p>
</div>

<p>The most useful case is that in which the central point is the
pole; the meridians are straight lines inclined to each other at the
true angular differences of longitude, and the parallels are equidistant
circles with the pole as centre. This is the best projection
to use for maps exhibiting the progress of polar discovery, and is
called the <i>polar equidistant projection</i>. The errors are smaller
than might be supposed. There are no scale errors along the
meridians, and along the parallels the scale error is (z / sin x) &minus; 1,
where z is the co-latitude of the parallel. On a parallel 10°
distant from the pole the error of scale is only 0.5%.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>General Theory of Zenithal Projections.</i>&mdash;For the sake of simplicity
it will be at first assumed that the pole is the centre of the map,
and that the earth is a sphere. According to what has been said
above, the meridians are now straight lines diverging from the pole,
dividing the 360° into equal angles; and the parallels are represented
by circles having the pole as centre, the radius of the parallel whose
co-latitude is z being &rho;, a certain function of z. The particular
function selected determines the nature of the projection.</p>

<p class="noind">then p&prime;q&prime; = &sigma;pq and p&prime;r&prime; = &sigma;&prime;pr. That is to
say, &sigma;, &sigma;&prime; may be regarded as the relative
scales, at co-latitude z, of the representation,
&sigma; applying to meridional measurements,
&sigma;&prime; to measurements perpendicular to the meridian. A small square
situated in co-latitude z, having one side in the direction of the
meridian&mdash;the length of its side being i&mdash;is represented by a
rectangle whose sides are i&sigma; and i&sigma;&prime;; its area consequently is i<span class="sp">2</span>&sigma;&sigma;&prime;.</p>
</div>

<p>If it were possible to make a perfect representation, then we
should have &sigma; = 1, &sigma;&prime; = 1 throughout. This, however, is impossible.
We may make &sigma; = 1 throughout by taking &rho; = z.
This is the <i>Equidistant Projection</i> just described, a very simple
and effective method of representation.</p>

<p>Or we may make &sigma;&prime;= 1 throughout. This gives &rho; = sin z, a
perspective projection, namely, the <i>Orthographic</i>.</p>

<p>Or we may require that areas be strictly represented in the
development. This will be effected by making &sigma;&sigma;&prime; = 1, or
&rho; d&rho; = sin z dz, the integral of which is &rho; = 2 sin <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>z, which is the
<i>Zenithal Equal-area Projection</i> of Lambert, sometimes, though
wrongly referred to as <i>Lorgna&rsquo;s Projection</i> after Antonio
Lorgna (b. 1736). In this system there is misrepresentation
of form, but no misrepresentation of areas.</p>

<p>Or we may require a projection in which all small parts are to
be represented in their true forms <i>i.e.</i> an orthomorphic projection.
For instance, a small square on the spherical surface is to be
represented as a small square in the development. This condition
will be attained by making &sigma; = &sigma;&prime;, or d&rho;/&rho; = dz/sin z, the
integral of which is, c being an arbitrary constant, &rho; = c tan <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>z.
This, again, is a perspective projection, namely, the <i>Stereographic</i>.
In this, though all small parts of the surface are represented in
their correct shapes, yet, the scale varying from one part of the
map to another, the <i>whole</i> is not a similar representation of the
original. The scale, &sigma; = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>c sec<span class="sp">2</span> <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>z, at any point, applies to all
directions round that point.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>These two last projections are, as it were, at the extremes of the
scale; each, perfect in its own way, is in other respects objectionable.
We may avoid both extremes by the following considerations.
Although we cannot make &sigma; = 1 and &sigma;&prime; = 1, so as to have a perfect
picture of the spherical surface, yet considering &sigma; &minus; 1 and &sigma;&prime; &minus; 1 as
the local errors of the representation, we may make (&sigma; &minus; 1)<span class="sp">2</span> +
(&sigma;&prime; &minus; 1)<span class="sp">2</span> a minimum over the whole surface to be represented.
To effect this we must multiply this expression by the element of
surface to which it applies, viz. sin zd zd &mu;, and then integrate from
the centre to the (circular) limits of the map. Let &beta; be the spherical
radius of the segment to be represented, then the total misrepresentation
is to be taken as</p>

<p>For simplicity of explanation we have supposed this method
of development so applied as to have the pole in the centre.
There is, however, no necessity for this, and any point on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page661" id="page661"></a>661</span>
surface of the sphere may be taken as the centre. All that is
necessary is to calculate by spherical trigonometry the azimuth
and distance, with reference to the assumed centre, of all the
points of intersection of meridians and parallels within the space
which is to be represented in a plane. Then the azimuth is
represented unaltered, and any spherical distance z is represented
by &rho;. Thus we get all the points of intersection transferred to
the representation, and it remains merely to draw continuous
lines through these points, which lines will be the meridians and
parallels in the representation.</p>

<p>Thus treating the earth as a sphere and applying the <i>Zenithal
Equal-area Projection</i> to the case of Africa, the central point
selected being on the equator, we have, if &theta; be the spherical
distance of any point from the centre, &phi;, &alpha; the latitude and
longitude (with reference to the centre), of this point, cos &theta; =
cos &phi; cos &alpha;. If A is the azimuth of this point at the centre, tan
A = sin &alpha; cot &phi;. On paper a line from the centre is drawn at an
azimuth A, and the distance &theta; is represented by 2 sin <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>&theta;. This
makes a very good projection for a single-sheet equal-area map
of Africa. The exaggeration in such systems, it is important to
remember, whether of linear scale, area, or angle, is the same
for a given distance from the centre, whatever be the azimuth;
that is, the exaggeration is a function of the distance from the
centre only.</p>

<p>Meridians are represented by straight lines drawn through
a point, and a difference of longitude &omega; is represented by an angle
h&omega;. The parallels of latitude are circular arcs, all having
as centre the point of divergence of the
meridian lines. It is clear that perspective
and zenithal projections are particular
groups of conical projections.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Let z be the co-latitude of a parallel, and
&rho;, a function of z, the radius of the circle
representing this parallel. Consider the infinitely
small space on the sphere contained
by two consecutive meridians, the difference
of whose longitude is d&mu;, and two consecutive
parallels whose co-latitudes are z
and z + dz. The sides of this rectangle are pq = dz, pr = sin z d&mu;;

<p>Now we may make &sigma; = 1 throughout, then &rho; = z + const. This
gives either the group of <i>conical projections with rectified meridians</i>,

<p>This projection, given by equations (i.) and (ii.), is Lambert&rsquo;s
orthomorphic projection&mdash;commonly called Gauss&rsquo;s projection;
its descriptive name is the <i>orthomorphic conical projection with two
standard parallels</i>.</p>

<p>The constant k in (i.) defines the scale and may be used to render
the scale errors along the selected parallels not nil but the same;
and some other parallel, <i>e.g.</i> the central parallel may then be made
errorless.</p>

<p>The value h = <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, as suggested by Sir John Herschel, is admirably
suited for a map of the world. The representation is fan-shaped,
with remarkably little distortion (fig. 24).</p>

if this parallel is the equator, so that z<span class="su">1</span> = 90°, kh = 1, then equation
(i.) becomes &rho; = (tan <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>z)<span class="sp">h</span>/h, and the radius of the equator = 1/h. The
distance r of any parallel from the equator is 1/h &minus; (tan <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>z)<span class="sp">h</span>/h =
(1/h){1 &minus; (tan <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>z)<span class="sp">h</span>}.</p>

r = (a/h){1 &minus; (tan <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>z)<span class="sp">h</span>}. When h is very small, the angles between
the meridian lines in the representation are very small; and proceeding
to the limit, when h is zero the meridians are parallel&mdash;that
is, the vertex of the cone has removed to infinity. And at the
limit when h is zero we have r = a log<span class="su">e</span> cot <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>z, which is the characteristic
equation of Mercator&rsquo;s projection.</p>

<p><i>Mercator&rsquo;s Projection.</i>&mdash;From the manner in which we have
arrived at this projection it is clear that it retains the characteristic
property of orthomorphic projections&mdash;namely, similarity
of representation of small parts of the surface. In Mercator&rsquo;s
chart the equator is represented by a straight line, which is
crossed at right angles by a system of parallel and equidistant
straight lines representing the meridians. The parallels are
straight lines parallel to the equator, and the distance of the
parallel of latitude &phi; from the equator is, as we have seen above,
r = a log<span class="su">e</span> tan (45° + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>&phi;). In the vicinity of the equator, or indeed
within 30° of latitude of the equator, the representation is very
accurate, but as we proceed northwards or southwards the
exaggeration of area becomes larger, and eventually excessive&mdash;the
poles being at infinity. This distance of the parallels may be
expressed in the form r = a (sin &phi; + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> sin<span class="sp">3</span> &phi; + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">5</span> sin<span class="sp">5</span> &phi; + ...),
showing that near the equator r is nearly proportional to the
latitude. As a consequence of the similar representation of
small parts, a curve drawn on the sphere cutting all meridians
at the same angle&mdash;the loxodromic curve&mdash;is projected into a
straight line, and it is this property which renders Mercator&rsquo;s
chart so valuable to seamen. For instance: join by a straight
line on the chart Land&rsquo;s End and Bermuda, and measure the
angle of intersection of this line with the meridian. We get thus
the bearing which a ship has to retain during its course between
these ports. This is not great-circle sailing, and the ship so
navigated does not take the shortest path. The projection of a
great circle (being neither a meridian nor the equator) is a curve
which cannot be represented by a simple algebraic equation.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>If the true spheroidal shape of the earth is considered, the semiaxes
being a and b, putting e = &radic;(a<span class="sp">2</span> &minus; b<span class="sp">2</span>) / a, and using common
logarithms, the distance of any parallel from the equator can be
shown to be</p>

<p class="noind">where M, the modulus of common logarithms, = 0.434294. Of
course Mercator&rsquo;s projection was not originally arrived at in the
manner above described; the description has been given to show
that Mercator&rsquo;s projection is a particular case of the conical orthomorphic
group. The introduction of the projection is due to the
fact that for navigation it is very desirable to possess charts which
shall give correct local outlines (<i>i.e.</i> in modern phraseology shall be
orthomorphic) and shall at the same time show as a straight line
any line which cuts the meridians at a constant angle. The latter
condition clearly necessitates parallel meridians, and the former
a continuous increase of scale as the equator is departed from,
<i>i.e.</i> the scale at any point must be equal to the scale at the equator
× sec. latitude. In early days the calculations were made by
assuming that for a small increase of latitude, say 1&prime;, the scale was
constant, then summing up the small lengths so obtained. Nowadays
(for simplicity the earth will be taken as a sphere) we should say
that a small length of meridian ad&phi; is represented in this projection
by a sec &phi; d&phi;, and the length of the meridian in the projection
between the equator and latitude &phi;,</p>

of this very important projection.</p>

<p>Mercator&rsquo;s projection, although indispensable at sea, is of little
value for land maps. For topographical sheets it is obviously
unsuitable; and in cases in which it is required to show large areas
on small scales on an orthomorphic projection, that form should
be chosen which gives two standard parallels (Lambert&rsquo;s conical
orthomorphic). Mercator&rsquo;s projection is often used in atlases for
maps of the world. It is not a good projection to select for this
purpose on account of the great exaggeration of scale near the
poles. The misconceptions arising from this exaggeration of scale
may, however, be corrected by the juxtaposition of a map of the
world on an equal-area projection.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to revert to the general consideration of
conical projections.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It has been shown that the scales of the projection (fig. 23) as

</div>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Projection by Rectangular Spheroidal Co-ordinates.</i></p>

<p>If in the simple conical projection the selected parallel is the
equator, this and the other parallels become parallel straight
lines and the meridians are straight lines spaced at equatorial
distances, cutting the parallels at right angles; the parallels are
their true distances apart. This projection is the <i>simple cylindrical</i>.
If now we imagine the touching cylinder turned through
a right-angle In such a way as to touch the sphere along any
meridian, a projection is obtained exactly similar to the last,
except that in this case we represent, not parallels and meridians,
but small circles parallel to the given meridian and great circles
at right angles to it. It is clear that the projection is a special
case of conical projection. The position of any point on the
earth&rsquo;s surface is thus referred, on this projection, to a selected
meridian as one axis, and any great circle at right angles to it as
the other. Or, in other words, any point is fixed by the length
of the perpendicular from it on to the fixed meridian and the
distance of the foot of the perpendicular from some fixed point
on the meridian, these spherical or spheroidal co-ordinates
being plotted as plane rectangular co-ordinates.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The perpendicular is really a plane section of the surface through
the given point at right angles to the chosen meridian, and may be
briefly called a great circle. Such a great circle clearly diverges
from the parallel; the exact difference in latitude and longitude
between the point and the foot of the perpendicular can be at once
obtained by ordinary geodetic formulae, putting the azimuth = 90°.
Approximately the difference of latitude in seconds is x<span class="sp">2</span> tan &phi;
cosec 1&Prime; / 2&rho;&nu; where x is the length of the perpendicular, &rho; that of
the radius of curvature to the meridian, &nu; that of the normal terminated
by the minor axis, &phi; the latitude of the foot of the perpendicular.
The difference of longitude in seconds is approximately x sec &rho;
cosec 1&Prime; / &nu;. The resulting error consists principally of an exaggeration
of scale north and south and is approximately equal to sec x
(expressing x in arc); it is practically independent of the extent in
latitude.</p>
</div>

<p>It is on this projection that the 1/2,500 Ordnance maps and
the 6-in. Ordnance maps of the United Kingdom are plotted, a
meridian being chosen for a group of counties. It is also used
for the 1-in., <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> in. and <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> in. Ordnance maps of England, the central
meridian chosen being that which passes through a point
in Delamere Forest in Cheshire. This projection should not as a
rule be used for topographical maps, but is suitable for cadastral
plans on account of the convenience of plotting the rectangular
co-ordinates of the very numerous trigonometrical or traverse
points required in the construction of such plans. As regards
the errors involved, a range of about 150 miles each side of the
central meridian will give a maximum error in scale in a north
and south direction of about 0.1%.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Elliptical Equal-area Projection.</i></p>

<p>In this projection, which is also called Mollweide&rsquo;s projection
the parallels are parallel straight lines and the meridians are
ellipses, the central meridian being a straight line at right angles
to the equator, which is equally divided. If the whole world is
represented on the spherical assumption, the equator is twice the
length of the central meridian. Each elliptical meridian has for
one axis the central meridian, and for the other the intercepted
portion of the equally divided equator. It follows that the
meridians 90° east and west of the central meridian form a circle.
It is easy to show that to preserve the property of equal areas
the distance of any parallel from the equator must be &radic;2 sin &delta;
where &pi; sin &phi; = 2&delta; + sin 2&delta;, &phi; being the latitude of the parallel.
The length of the central meridian from pole to pole = 2 &radic;2,
where the radius of the sphere is unity. The length of the equator
= 4 &radic;2.</p>

<p>The following equal-area projections may be used to exhibit
the entire surface of the globe: Cylindrical equal area, Sinusoidal
equal area and Elliptical equal area.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Conventional or Arbitrary Projections.</i></p>

<p>These projections are devised for simplicity of drawing and
not for any special properties. The most useful projection of
this class is the <i>globular projection</i>. This is a conventional
representation of a hemisphere in which the equator and central
meridian are two equal straight lines at right angles, their intersection
being the centre of the circular boundary. The meridians
divide the equator into equal parts and are arcs of circles passing
through points so determined and the poles. The parallels are
arcs of circles which divide the central and extreme meridians
into equal parts. Thus in fig. 26 NS = EW and each is divided
into equal parts (in this case each division is 10°); the circumference
NESW is also divided into 10° spaces and circular arcs are
drawn through the corresponding points. This is a simple and
effective projection and one well suited for conveying ideas of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page663" id="page663"></a>663</span>
general shape and position of the chief land masses; it is better
for this purpose than the stereographic, which is commonly

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Projections for Field Sheets.</i></p>

<p>Field sheets for topographical surveys should be on conical
projections with rectified meridians; these projections for small
areas and ordinary topographical scales&mdash;not less than 1/500,000&mdash;are
sensibly errorless. But to save labour it is customary to
employ for this purpose either form of polyconic projection, in
which the errors for such scales are also negligible. In some
surveys, to avoid the difficulty of plotting the flat arcs required
for the parallels, the arcs are replaced by polygons, each side
being the length of the portion of the arc it replaces. This
method is especially suitable for scales of 1 : 125,000 and larger,
but it is also sometimes used for smaller scales.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Fig. 27 shows the method of plotting the projection for a field
sheet. Such a projection is usually called a graticule. In this
case ABC is the central meridian; the true meridian lengths of 30&prime;
spaces are marked on this meridian, and to each of these, such as
AB, the figure (in this case representing a square half degree), such
as ABED, is applied. Thus the point D is the intersection of a
circle of radius AD with a circle of radius BD, these lengths being
taken from geodetic tables. The method has no merit except that
of convenience.</p>

<p>Of the above 25 projections, 23 are conical or quasi-conical,
if zenithal and perspective projections be included. The projections
may, if it is preferred, be grouped according to their properties.
Thus in the above list 8 are equal-area, 3 are orthomorphic, 1 balances
errors, 1 represents all great circles by straight lines, and in 5 one
system of great circles is represented correctly.</p>

<p>Among projections which have not been described may be mentioned
the circular orthomorphic (Lagrange&rsquo;s) and the rectilinear
equal-area (Collignon&rsquo;s) and a considerable number of conventional
projections, which latter are for the most part of little value.</p>

<p>The choice of a projection depends on the function which the
map is intended to fulfil. If the map is intended for statistical
purposes to show areas, density of population, incidence of rainfall,
of disease, distribution of wealth, &amp;c., an <i>equal-area</i> projection
should be chosen. In such a case an area scale should be given.
At sea, <i>Mercator&rsquo;s</i> is practically the only projection used except
when it is desired to determine graphically great circle courses in
great oceans, when the <i>central</i> projection must be employed. For
conveying good general ideas of the shape and distribution of the
surface features of continents or of a hemisphere <i>Clarke&rsquo;s perspective</i>
projection is the best. For exhibiting the progress of polar exploration
the <i>polar equidistant</i> projection should be selected. For special
maps for general use on scales of 1/1,000,000 and smaller, and for a
series of which the sheets are to fit together, the <i>conical, with rectified
meridians and two standard parallels</i>, is a good projection. For
topographical maps, in which each sheet is plotted independently
and the scale is not smaller than 1/500,000, either form of <i>polyconic</i>
is very convenient.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAPLE, SIR JOHN BLUNDELL,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> <span class="sc">Bart.</span> (1845-1903), English
business magnate, was born on the 1st of March 1845. His
father, John Maple (d. 1900), had a small furniture shop in
Tottenham Court Road, London, and his business began to
develop about the time that his son entered it. The practical
management soon devolved on the younger Maple, under whom
it attained colossal dimensions. The firm became a limited
liability company, with a capital of two millions, in 1890, with
Mr Maple as chairman. He entered parliament as Conservative
member for Dulwich in 1887, was knighted in 1892, and was
made a baronet in 1897. He was the owner of a large stud of
race-horses, and from 1885 onwards won many important races,
appearing at first under the name of &ldquo;Mr Childwick.&rdquo; His
public benefactions included a hospital and a recreation ground
to the city of St Albans, near which his residence, Childwickbury,
was situated, and the rebuilding, at a cost of more than £150,000,
of University College Hospital, London. He died on the 24th of
November 1903. His only surviving daughter married in 1896
Baron von Eckhardstein, of the German Embassy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAPLE,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> in botany. The maple (O.E. <i>mapel-tréow, mapulder</i>)
and sycamore trees are species of <i>Acer</i>, of the order <i>Acerineae</i>.
The genus includes about sixty species, natives of Europe,
North America and Asia, especially the Himalayas, China and
Japan. Maples are for the most part trees with opposite, long-stalked,
palmately lobed leaves. The flowers are in fascicles,
appearing before the leaves as in the Norway maple, or in racemes
or panicles appearing with, or later than, the leaves as in sycamore.
Some of the flowers are often imperfect, the stamens or
pistil being more or less aborted. The fruit is a two-winged
&ldquo;samara.&rdquo; The genus was represented in the Tertiary flora of
Europe, when it extended into the polar regions; nineteen
species have been recorded from the Miocene strata of Oeningen
in Switzerland. The common maple, <i>A. campestre</i>, is the only
species indigenous to Great Britain. This and the sycamore
were described by Gerard in 1597 (<i>Herball</i>, p. 1299), the latter
being &ldquo;a stranger to England.&rdquo; Many species have been introduced,
especially from Japan, for ornamental purposes. The
following are more especially worthy of notice.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Acer campestre</i>, the common maple, is common in hedgerows,
but less often seen as a tree, when it is seldom more than 20 ft.
high, though in sheltered situations 30 ft. or more is attained. The
leaves are generally less than 2 in. across, and the five main lobes
are blunter than in the sycamore. The clusters of green flowers
terminate the young shoots and are erect; the two wings of the
fruit spread almost horizontally, and are smaller than in the sycamore.
It occurs in northern Europe, the Caucasus, and northern
Asia. The wood is excellent fuel, and makes the best charcoal.
It is compact, of a fine grain, sometimes beautifully veined, and
takes a high polish. Hence it has been celebrated from antiquity
for tables, &amp;c. The wood of the roots is frequently knotted, and
valuable for small objects of cabinet work. The young shoots,
being flexible and tough, are employed in France as whips.</p>

<p><i>A. pseudo-platanus</i>, the sycamore or great maple, is a handsome
tree of quick growth, with a smooth bark. The leaves are large,
with finely acute and serrated lobes, affording abundant shade.
The flowers are borne in long pendulous racemes, and the two wings
of the fruit are ascending. It lives from 140 to 200 years. It is
found wild chiefly in wooded mountainous situations in central
Europe. The wood when young is white, but old heartwood is
yellow or brownish. Like the common maple it is hard and takes
a high polish. It is much prized by wheelwrights, cabinet-makers,
sculptors, &amp;c., on the Continent; while knotted roots are used for
inlaying. Sugar has been obtained from the sap of this as from
other species, the most being one ounce from a quart of sap. The
latter has also been made into wine in the Highlands of Scotland.
It withstands the sea and mountain breezes better than most other
timber trees, and is often planted near farm-houses and cottages in
exposed localities for the sake of its dense foliage. Its wood is
valued in turnery for cups, bowls and pattern blocks. It produces
abundance of seeds, and is easily raised, but it requires good and
tolerably dry soil; it will not thrive on stiff clays nor on dry sands
or chalks. There are many varieties, the variegated and cut-leaved
being the most noticeable. The lobed shape of its leaf
and its dense foliage caused it to be confused with the true sycamore&mdash;<i>Ficus
sycamorus</i>&mdash;of scripture.</p>

<p><i>A. platanoides</i>, the Norway maple, is met with from Norway to
Italy, Greece, and central and south Russia. It was introduced
into Britain in 1683. It is a lofty tree (from 40 to 70 ft.), resembling
the sycamore, but with yellow flowers, appearing before the leaves,
and more spreading wings to the fruit. There are several varieties.
The wood is used for the same purposes as that of the sycamore.
Sugar has been made from the sap in Norway and Sweden.</p>

<p>Many varieties of <i>A. palmatum</i>, generally known as <i>polymorphum</i>,
with variously laciniated and more or less coloured foliage, have
been introduced from Japan as ornamental shrubs. The branches
and corolla are purple, the fruit woolly. The foliage of the typical
form is bright green with very pointed lobes. It occurs in the
central mountains of Nippon and near Nagasaki. Beautiful
varieties have been introduced under the varietal names, <i>ampelopsifolium</i>,
<i>atropurpureum</i>, <i>dissectum</i>, &amp;c. They are remarkable for
the coppery purple tint that pervades the leaves and young growths
of some of the varieties. Other Japanese species are <i>A. japonicum</i>,
the varieties of which are among the most handsome of small
deciduous shrubs; <i>A. rufinerve</i>, with the habit of the sycamore;
<i>A. distylum</i>, bearing leaves without lobes; <i>A. diabolicum</i>, with
large plane-like leaves; and <i>A. carpinifolium</i>, with foliage resembling
that of the hornbeam.</p>

<p><i>A. saccharinum</i>, a North American species, the sugar, rock, or
bird&rsquo;s-eye maple, was introduced in 1735. It sometimes attains
to 70 or even over 100 ft., more commonly 50 to 60 ft. It is remarkable
for the whiteness of the bark. The wood is white, but acquires
a rosy tinge after exposure to light. The grain is fine and close,
and when polished has a silky lustre. The timber is used instead
of oak where the latter is scarce, and is employed for axle-trees
and spokes, as well as for Windsor chairs, &amp;c. It exhibits two
accidental forms in the arrangement of the fibres, an undulated
one like those of the curled maple (<i>A. rubrum</i>), and one of spots,
which gives the name bird&rsquo;s-eye to the wood of this species. Like
the curled maple, it is used for inlaying mahogany. It is much
prized for bedsteads, writing-desks, shoe-lasts, &amp;c. The wood
forms excellent fuel and charcoal, while the ashes are rich in alkaline
principles, furnishing a large proportion of the potash exported
from Boston and New York. Sugar is principally extracted from
this species, the sap being boiled and the syrup when reduced to
a proper consistence runs into moulds to form cakes. Trees growing
in low and moist situations afford the most sap but least sugar.
A cold north-west wind, with frosty nights and sunny days in
alternation, tends to incite the flow, which is more abundant during
the day than the night. A thawing night is said to promote the
flow, and it ceases during a south-west wind and at the approach of
a storm; and so sensitive are the trees to aspect and climatic variations
that the flow of sap on the south and east side has been noticed
to be earlier than on the north and west side of the same tree.
The average quantity of sap per tree is from 12 to 24 gallons in a
season.</p>

<p><i>A. rubrum</i>, the red-flowering or scarlet maple, is a middle-sized
tree, and was introduced in 1656. The bright scarlet or dull red
flowers appear before the leaves in March and April. The wood,
like that of other species, is applicable to many purposes&mdash;as for
the seats of Windsor chairs, turnery, &amp;c. The grain in very old
trees is sometimes undulated, which suggested the name of curled
maple, and gives beautiful effects of light and shade on polished
surfaces. The most constant use of curled maple is for the stocks
of fowling-pieces and rifles, as it affords toughness and strength
combined with lightness and elegance. The inner bark is dusky
red. On boiling, it yields a purple colour which with sulphate of
iron affords a black dye. The wood is inferior to that of the preceding
species in strength and as fuel. Sugar was made from the
sap by the French Canadians, but the production is only half as
great as that from the sugar maple. In Britain it is cultivated as
an ornamental tree, as being conspicuous for its flowers in spring,
and for its red fruit and foliage in autumn.</p>

<p><i>A. macrophyllum</i>, a north-western American species, is a valuable
timber tree.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAPU, ABRAHAM<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1808-1867), Hebrew novelist. His
works are chiefly historical romances in Hebrew. His most
famous books were <i>The Love of Zion</i> and the <i>Transgression of
Samaria</i>. Besides their intrinsic merits, these novels stand high
among the works which produced the romantic movement in
modern Hebrew literature. Mapu&rsquo;s plots were somewhat sensational,
incident being more prominent than characterization.
But underlying all was a criticism of contemporary life. His
novels made a deep impression and became instantly popular.
Mapu&rsquo;s Hebrew style is simple and classical. An English translation
of the <i>Love of Zion</i> bears the title <i>Amnon, Prince and
Peasant</i>, by F. Jaffe (1887). Mapu&rsquo;s stories have been often
translated into other languages.</p>

Tlemcen in Algeria and studied at Fez and Marrakesh, where he
remained engaged in literary work until he made the pilgrimage
to Mecca in 1618. In the following year he settled in Cairo.
In 1620 he visited Jerusalem and Damascus, and during the
next six years made the pilgrimage five times. In 1628 he
was again in Damascus, where he gave a course of lectures on
Bukh&#257;r&#299;&rsquo;s collection of <i>Traditions</i>, spoke much of the glories of
Moslem Spain, and received the impulse to write his work on this
subject later. In the same year he returned to Cairo, where
he spent a year in writing his history. He was just making
preparations to settle definitely in Damascus when he died in
1632.</p>

(1364-1442), Arabian historian, known as al-Maqr&#299;z&#299; because of his
ancestral connexion with Maqr&#299;z, a suburb of Baalbek, was born
at Cairo and spent most of his life in Egypt, where he was trained
in the Hanifite school of law, though later he became a Sh&#257;fi&rsquo;ite
with an inclination to Z&#257;hirite views. In 1385 he made the
pilgrimage. For some time he was secretary in a government
office, and in 1399 became inspector of markets for Cairo and
northern Egypt. This post he soon gave up to become preacher
at the mosque of &lsquo;Amr, president of the mosque ul-H&#257;kim, and a
lecturer on tradition. In 1408 he went to Damascus to become
inspector of the Qal&#257;nis&#299;yya and lecturer. Later he retired
into private life at Cairo. In 1430 he made the pilgrimage
with his family and travelled for some five years. His learning
was great, his observation accurate and his judgment good, but
his books are largely compilations, and he does not always
acknowledge the sources to which he is indebted. Most of his
works are concerned with Egypt. The most important is the

<p><span class="bold">MAR, EARLDOM OF.<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> Mar, one of the ancient divisions or
provinces of Scotland, comprised the larger portion of Aberdeenshire,
extending from north of the Don southward to the Mounth.
Like other such districts, it was in Celtic times under the rule of a
<i>mormaer</i>. In the 12th century his place was taken by an earl,
but no definite succession of earls appears till the 13th century,
nor is any connexion established between them and the <i>mormaers</i>.
From the middle of the 13th century the earls were recognized
as among &ldquo;the seven earls of Scotland&rdquo; and held a great position.
Earl Gratney (<i>fl.</i> <i>c.</i> 1300) married a sister of (King)
Robert Bruce, who brought him the lordship of Garioch and
castle of Kildrummy, which she held against the earl of Athole,
an ally of the English (1335). Their son Donald was made
regent in July 1332, but was disastrously defeated and slain
at Dupplin next month. His daughter and eventual heir,
Margaret, brought the earldom to her husband, William, earl of
Douglas, and on the accession of her daughter Isabél a troublous
time followed.</p>

<p>While she was living as a widow at her castle of Kildrummy,
it was stormed by Alexander Stewart, a bastard, who forced her
to execute a charter (August 12, 1404) settling the reversion
to the earldom on himself and his heirs. This act she revoked
by a charter of the 19th of September 1404, which cannot now
be found; but on marrying him, on the 9th of December 1404,
she granted him the earldom for life, the king confirming this
on the 21st of June 1405. After her death in 1408 the earl
played a great part, commanding the royal forces at the battle
of Harlaw, when the Lord of the Isles was defeated in 1411,
and afterwards acting as warden of the Marches. In 1426 he
resigned the earldom to the Crown, the king granting it by a
fresh creation to him and certain heirs, with reversion to the
Crown. On the earl&rsquo;s death in 1435 the earldom was claimed by
Robert, Lord Erskine, as heir of Gratney, earl of Mar, through a
daughter; but the Crown claimed as reversionary under the
creation of 1426. A long struggle followed, till in 1457 James II.
obtained from a justiciary court at Aberdeen a recognition
of the Crown&rsquo;s right to the earldom and its lands, and shortly
after bestowed them on his son John as earl of Mar and Garioch.
He died unmarried in 1479, and in 1483 his elder brother
Alexander duke of Albany received the earldom, but was soon
forfeited. James III. created his son John earl of Mar and
Garioch in 1486, and after his death unmarried in 1503, James IV.
alienated to Lord Elphinstone (1507-1510) many of the Mar
lands, including Kildrummy. The title was not revived till 1562,
when James Stewart, earl of Murray, held it for a few months.</p>

<p>In 1565 John, Lord Erskine, succeeded in getting returned
heir to the earldom, and shortly after (June 23, 1565) Queen
Margaret restored the charter to him and his heirs &ldquo;all and
hail the said earldom of Mar.&rdquo; As earl he took part against the
queen in 1567, and in 1571 was made regent of Scotland, which
post he retained till his death (1572). His son, earl John (<i>c.</i> 1558-1634),
played a great part in the history of the family. His
great achievement was the recovery of the Mar estates, alienated
by the Crown during the long period that his family had
been out of possession, including Kildrummy, the &ldquo;head&rdquo; of the
earldom. It was in his time that the precedence of the earldom
(see below) was settled. John, the next earl (<i>c.</i> 1585-1654) was
a Royalist, as was his son John (d. 1668), much to the injury of
the family fortune, which was further impaired by the attachment
of the family, after the Revolution, to the Stuarts. His son
Charles (1650-1689) was arrested by the government just before
his death (1689), and the next earl, John (1675-1732), a prominent
Jacobite (see below), was attainted, the earldom remaining
under forfeiture for 108 years; by the Old Pretender he was
created duke of Mar.</p>

<p>Alloa and other Erskine estates of the attainted earl were repurchased
for the family, and descended to John Francis Erskine
(1741-1825), his heir-male, who was also his heir of line through
his daughter. To him, in his eighty-third year, as grandson and
lineal representative of the attainted earl, the earldom was
restored by act of parliament in 1824. His grandson, who
succeeded him in 1828, inherited the earldom of Kellie (1619) and
other Erskine dignities by decision of 1835. At his death in 1866,
his earldom of Mar was the subject of rival claims, and the right
to the succession was not determined till 1875. His estates
passed to his cousin and heir-male, who succeeded to his earldom
of Kellie and claimed &ldquo;the honour and dignity of earl of Mar.&rdquo;
But the latter was also claimed by a Mr Goodeve, whose father
had married the late earl&rsquo;s eldest sister, and who assumed the
title. It was not suggested that the late earl had more than one
earldom of Mar, but Lord Kellie claimed it as descendible to
heirs-male under a creation by Queen Mary, and Mr Goodeve as
descendible to heirs of line under an earlier creation. The House
of Lords decided (Feb. 25, 1875) that Lord Kellie was entitled
to the earldom as having been created by Queen Mary in 1565,
with a limitation which must be presumed to be to heirs-male of
the body. This decision gave great dissatisfaction, but was
described as &ldquo;final, right or wrong, and not to be questioned&rdquo; by
Lord Selborne and the lord chancellor in 1877, and Lord Kellie
was thenceforth recognized as holding the earldom on the Union
Roll, the only one known, though Mr Goodeve continued to
assume the title. The Lords&rsquo; decision could not be reversed,
but in 1885, after much agitation, a means was found of evading
it in practice by the &ldquo;Earldom of Mar Restitution Act.&rdquo; By
&ldquo;an equivocation on the facts of the case,&rdquo; it was recited that
&ldquo;doubts may exist whether the said ancient honour, dignity,
and title of peerage of earl of Mar ... was or was not ... by
any lawful means surrendered or merged in the Crown&rdquo; before
1565, and that the House of Lords had decided that Queen Mary&rsquo;s
known charter of 1565 applied only to lands and &ldquo;did not operate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page666" id="page666"></a>666</span>
or extend to restore&rdquo; the peerage dignity, and enacted that
&ldquo;John Francis Erskine Goodeve Erskine&rdquo; (which last name the
claimant had added) should be &ldquo;restored to&rdquo; the ancient earldom.
His previous assumption of the title was thus rejected as invalid,
but from the passing of the act two earldoms of Mar were in
existence, that of Lord Kellie being confirmed and allowed the
precedence of 1565, while the restored earldom was allowed that
of the dignity on the Union Roll, the only one known till then.
This precedence had been assigned to it by the Decreet of
Ranking (1606), and assigns to it an origin in 1404 (or, as some
say, 1395). It is frequently, but absurdly, stated to have been
&ldquo;created before 1014,&rdquo; and wrongly spoken of as the Premier
Scottish Earldom (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Earl</a></span>). A barony of Garioch is also
wrongly said to be annexed to it, but the title is used by the
earl&rsquo;s eldest son in default of any other.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAR, JOHN ERSKINE,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st or 6th Earl of</span> (d. 1572), regent
of Scotland, was a son of John, 5th Lord Erskine (d. 1552), who
was guardian of King James V., and afterwards of Mary Queen
of Scots. The younger John, who succeeded his father as 6th
Lord Erskine in 1552, joined the religious reformers, but he was
never very ardent in the cause, although he subscribed the letter
asking Knox to return to Scotland in 1557. The custody of
Edinburgh Castle was in his hands, and during the struggle
between the regent, Mary of Lorraine, and the lords of the
Congregation he appears to have acted consistently in the
interests of peace. When Mary Stuart returned to Scotland
in 1561 Lord Erskine was a member of her council, he favoured
her marriage with Lord Darnley, and his wife, Annabella Murray,
called by Knox a &ldquo;verray Jesabell,&rdquo; was a frequent companion
of the queen. In 1565 Erskine was granted the earldom of Mar
(see above). As guardian of James, afterwards King James VI.,
he prevented the young prince from falling into the hands of
Bothwell, and when the Scottish nobles rose against Mary and
Both well, Mar was one of their leaders; he took part in the government
of Scotland during Mary&rsquo;s imprisonment at Lochleven, and
also after her subsequent abdication. In September 1571 he was
chosen regent of Scotland, but he was overshadowed and perhaps
slighted by the earl of Morton, and he died at Stirling on the 29th
of October 1572.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAR, JOHN ERSKINE,<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> <span class="sc">2nd or 7th Earl of</span> (<i>c.</i> 1558-1634),
Scottish politician, was the only son of the preceding. Together
with King James VI. he was educated by George Buchanan.
After attaining his majority he was nominally the guardian of
the young king, who was about seven years his junior, and who
lived with him at Stirling; but he was in reality a puppet in the
hands of the regent, the earl of Morton; and he lost power and
position when Morton was imprisoned. He was concerned in the
seizure of James VI. in 1582 (a plot known as the raid of Ruthven);
but when James escaped from his new custodians the earl
fled into the west of Scotland. Then leaving his hiding-place Mar
seized Stirling Castle, whereupon James marched against him,
and he took refuge in England. Queen Elizabeth interceded for
him, but in vain, and after some futile communications between
the governments of England and Scotland Mar and his friends
gathered an army, entered the presence of the king at Stirling,
and were soon in supreme authority (1585). Mar was restored to
his lands and titles. Henceforward he stood high in the royal
favour; he became governor of Edinburgh Castle and was made
tutor to James&rsquo;s son, Prince Henry, and for his second wife he
married Mary, daughter of Esmé Stewart, duke of Lennox. In
1601 the earl was sent as envoy to London; here Elizabeth
assured him that James should be her successor, and his mission
was conducted with tact and prudence. Having joined the
English privy council Mar was created Lord Cardross in 1610;
he was a member of the Court of High Commission and was lord
high treasurer of Scotland from 1615 to 1630. He died at Stirling
on the 14th of December 1634. John (<i>c.</i> 1585-1654), his only
son by his first wife, succeeded to his earldom; by his second wife
he had five sons, among them being James (d. 1640), earl of
Buchan; Henry (d. 1628), whose son David (d. 1671) succeeded
to the barony of Cardross; and Charles, the ancestor of the earls
of Rosslyn.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAR, JOHN ERSKINE,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> <span class="sc">6th or 11th Earl of</span> (1675-1732),
Scottish Jacobite, was the eldest son of Charles, the 5th earl
(1650-1689), from whom he inherited estates which were heavily
loaded with debt. He was associated with the party favourable
to the English government; he was one of the commissioners for
the Union, and was made a Scottish secretary of state, becoming
after the Union of 1707 a representative peer for Scotland,
keeper of the signet and a privy councillor. In 1713 Mar was
made an English secretary of state by the Tories, but he seems
to have been equally ready to side with the Whigs, and in 1714 he
assured the new king, George I., of his loyalty. However, like
the other Tories, he was deprived of his office, and in August 1715
he went in disguise to Scotland and placed himself at the head
of the adherents of James Edward, the Old Pretender. Meeting
many Highland chieftains at Aboyne he avowed an earnest
desire for the independence of Scotland, and at Braemar on the
6th of September 1715 he proclaimed James VIII. king of Scotland,
England, France and Ireland. Gradually the forces under
his command were augmented, but as a general he was a complete
failure. Precious time was wasted at Perth, a feigned attack on
Stirling was resultless, and he could give little assistance to the
English Jacobites. At Sheriffmuir, where a battle was fought
in November 1715, Mar&rsquo;s forces largely outnumbered those of his
opponent, Archibald Campbell, afterwards 3rd duke of Argyll;
but no bravery could atone for the signal incompetence displayed
by the earl, and the fight was virtually a decisive defeat for the
Jacobites. Mar then met James Edward at Fetteresso; the
cause however was lost, and the prince and the earl fled to France.
Mar sought to interest foreign powers in the cause of the Stuarts;
but in the course of time he became thoroughly distrusted
by the Jacobites. In 1721 he accepted a pension of £3500 a year
from George I., and in the following year his name was freely
mentioned in connexion with the trial of Bishop Atterbury,
whom it was asserted that Mar had betrayed. This charge may
perhaps be summarized as not proven. At the best his conduct
was highly imprudent, and in 1724 he left the Pretender&rsquo;s
service. His later years were spent in Paris and at Aix-la-Chapelle,
where he died in May 1732.</p>

<p>Mar, who was known as &ldquo;bobbing John,&rdquo; married for his
second wife, Frances (d. 1761), daughter of the 1st duke of
Kingston, and was thus a brother-in-law of Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu. He had been attainted in 1716, and his only son,
Thomas, Lord Erskine, died childless in March 1766.</p>

<p>Mar&rsquo;s brother, <span class="sc">James Erskine</span> (1679-1754), was educated as a
lawyer and became lord justice clerk of the Court of Session and
Lord Grange in 1710. He took no part in the rising of 1715,
although there is little doubt that at times he was in communication
with the Jacobites; but was rather known for his piety and
for his sympathy with the Presbyterians. He is more famous,
however, owing to the story of his wife&rsquo;s disappearance. This
lady, Rachel Chicely, was a woman of disordered intellect;
probably with reason she suspected her husband of infidelity,
and after some years of unhappiness Grange arranged a plan
for her seizure. In January 1732 she was conveyed with
great secrecy from Edinburgh to the island of Hesker, thence
to St Kilda, where she remained for about ten years, thence
she was taken to Assynt in Sutherland, and finally to Skye.
To complete the idea that she was dead her funeral was
publicly celebrated, but she survived until May 1745. Meanwhile
in 1734 Grange had resigned his judgeship and had become
an English member of parliament; here he was a bitter opponent
of Sir Robert Walpole. He died in London on the 20th of
January 1754.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARA, GERTRUD ELISABETH<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> (1749-1833), German
singer, was born at Cassel, the daughter of a poor musician
named Schmeling. From him she learnt the violin, and while
still a child her playing at the fair at Frankfort was so remarkable
that money was collected to provide for her. She was helped by
influential friends, and studied under Hillel at Leipzig for five
years, proving to be endowed with a wonderful soprano voice.
She began to sing in public in 1771, and was soon recognized as
the greatest singer that Germany had produced. She was
permanently engaged for the Prussian Court, but her marriage
to a debauched violinist named Mara created difficulties, and
in 1780 she was released. After singing at Vienna, Munich and
elsewhere, she appeared in Paris in 1782, where her rivalry with
the singer Todi developed into a regular faction. In 1784 she
went to London, and continued to appear there with great
success, with visits at intervals to Italy and to Paris till 1802,
when for some years she retired to Russia. She visited England
again in 1819, but then abandoned the stage. She went to
Livonia, and died on the 20th of January 1833 at Revel.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARABOUT<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> (the French form of the Arab. <i>mur&#257;bit</i>, &ldquo;one
who pickets his horse on a hostile frontier&rdquo;; cf. Portug. <i>marabute</i>;
Span. <i>morabito</i>), in Mahommedan religion a hermit or devotee.
The word is derived from <i>rib&#257;&#7789;</i>, a fortified frontier station. To
such stations pious men betook them to win religious merit in
war against the infidel; their leisure was spent in devotion, and
the habits of the convent superseded those of the camp (see
M&rsquo;G. De Slane in <i>Jour. As.</i>, 1842, i. 168; Dozy, <i>Suppl.</i> i. 502).
Thus <i>rib&#257;&#7789;</i> came to mean a religious house or hospice (<i>z&#257;wiya</i>).
The great sphere of the marabouts is North Africa. There it
was that the community formed by Yahya b. Ibr&#257;h&#299;m and the
doctor Abdullah developed into the conquering empire of the
Mur&#257;bi&#7789;s, or, as Christian writers call them, the <span class="sc">Almoravides</span>
(<i>q.v.</i>), and there still, among the Berbers, the marabouts enjoy
extraordinary influence, being esteemed as living saints and
mediators. They are liberally supported by alms, direct all
popular assemblies, and have a decisive voice in intertribal
quarrels and all matters of consequence. On their death their
sanctity is transferred to their tombs (also called marabouts),
where chapels are erected and gifts and prayers offered. The
marabouts took a prominent part in the resistance offered to the
French by the Algerian Moslems; and they have been similarly
active in politico-religious movements in Tunisia and Tripoli.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARACAIBO,<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> a large lake of western Venezuela, extending
southward from the Gulf of Venezuela, into which it opens
through a long neck, or strait, obstructed at its mouth by islands
and bars, and having a large drainage basin bounded on the
W. by the Eastern Cordillera, on the S.E. by the Cordillera de
Merida, and on the E. by a low range of mountains extending
N. by W. from Trujillo to the coast. The lake is roughly quadrangular
in shape, and extends from the 9th to the 11th parallel
of S. lat. and from the 71st to the 72nd meridian. It opens into
the Gulf through 13 channels, the depth on the bar in the main
channel ranging from 7 ft. at low water to 12 ft. at high water.
Inside the bar the depth is about 30 ft., and the lake is navigable
for vessels of large size. It receives the waters of many rivers,
principally on its west and south sides, the largest of which are
the Catatumbo and Zulia, Escalante, Chanudo, Ceniza, Sant&rsquo;Ana,
Negro, Apan and Palmar. The first three have navigable channels
for river steamers. There are a number of small lakes near
Lake Maracaibo&rsquo;s southern and western margins, the largest of
which is the Laguna de Zulia. The heavy rainfall on the eastern
slopes of the Eastern Cordillera, which is said to exceed 86 in.
per annum, is responsible for the great volume of water discharged
into the lake. The average annual precipitation over
the whole basin is said to be 70 in. In the upper half of the lake
the water is sweet, but below that, where the tidal influence is
stronger, it becomes brackish. The only port of consequence
on the lake is Maracaibo, but there are small ports at its upper
end which are in direct communication with the inland cities of
Trujillo, Merida and San Cristobal. The Catatumbo River,
which enters from the west near the north end of the lake, and
its principal tributary, the Zulia, are navigable as far as Villamizar,
in Colombia, and afford an excellent transportation
route for the coffee and other products of Santander.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARACAIBO<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> (sometimes <span class="sc">Maracaybo</span>), a city and seaport of
Venezuela and capital of the state of Zulia (formerly Maracaibo),
on the west shore of the broad channel or neck which connects
Lake Maracaibo with the Gulf of Venezuela, or Maracaibo,
about 25 m. from the mouth of the channel opening into the latter.
Pop. (1889), 34,284; (1905), 49,817; there is a considerable
German element in the vicinity. The best residential suburb,
Haticos, extends along the lake shore toward the south. The
city is provided with tramways, telephone service and electric
lighting, but the water supply and drainage are inferior. The
most important buildings are the executive&rsquo;s residence, the
legislative chambers, the municipal hall, the Baralt theatre, the
prison, the market, a hospital and six churches. The city also
has a school of arts, a public library, and a public garden. In
colonial times Maracaibo had a famous Jesuits&rsquo; college (now
gone) and was one of the educational centres of Spanish America;
the city now has a national college and a nautical school.
The industries include shipbuilding, and the manufacture of
saddlery and other leather products, bricks and tile, rum, beer,
chocolate and coco-nut oil. Maracaibo is chiefly known,
however, as one of the principal commercial centres and shipping
ports on the northern coast of South America. The bar at the
entrance to Maracaibo channel does not admit vessels drawing
more than 12 ft., but there is a depth of 30 ft. inside and near the
city. Steam communication is maintained on the Catatumbo
and Zulia rivers to Villamizar, and on the Escalante to Santa
Cruz. The principal exports from Maracaibo are coffee, hides
and skins, cabinet and dye-woods, cocoa, and mangrove bark,
to which may be added dividivi, sugar, copaiba, gamela and hemp
straw for paper-making, and fruits. In 1906, 26% of the coffee
exports was of Colombian origin.</p>

<p>Maracaibo was founded in 1571 by Alonso Pacheco, who gave
it the name Nueva Zamora. Up to 1668 the entrepôt for the
inland settlements was a station named Gibraltar at the head of
the lake, but the destruction of that station by pirates in that
year transferred this valuable trade to Maracaibo. The city did
not figure actively in the War of Independence until 1821 (Jan.
28), when the province declared its independence and sought an
alliance with Colombia. This brought to an end the armistice
between Bolívar and Morillo, and thenceforward the city experienced
all the changing fortunes of war until its final capture
by the revolutionists in 1823.</p>

running nearly north and south at the eastern extremity of a
well-cultivated plain opening towards Lake Urmia, which lies
18 m. to the west. The town is encompassed by a high wall
ruined in many places, and has four gates. Two stone bridges in
good condition, said to have been constructed during the reign
of Hulaku Khan (1256-1265), and since then several times
repaired, lead over the Safi River on the western side of the town.
The place is surrounded by extensive vineyards and orchards,
all well watered by canals led from the river, and producing
great quantities of fruit for exportation to Russia. On a hill
west of the town are the remains of a famous observatory (<i>rasad</i>)
constructed under the direction of the great astronomer Nasr-ud-din
of Tus. The hills west of the town consist of horizontal
strata of sandstone covered with irregular pieces of basalt and
the top of the hill on which the observatory stood was made level
by taking away the basalt. The building, which no doubt served
as a citadel as well, enclosed a space of 380 yds. by 150, and the
foundations of the walls were 4<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> to 5 ft. in thickness. The
marble, which is known throughout Persia as Mar&#257;gha marble,
is a travertine obtained at the village of Dashkesen (Turkish for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page668" id="page668"></a>668</span>
&ldquo;stone-breakers&rdquo;) about 30 m. north-west from Maragha. It
is deposited from water, which bubbles up from a number of
springs in the form of horizontal layers, which at first are thin
crusts and can easily be broken, but gradually solidify and
harden into blocks with a thickness of 7 to 8 in. It is a singularly
beautiful substance, being of pink, greenish, or milk-white
colour, streaked with reddish, copper-coloured veins. An
analysis of the marble gave the following result: calcium
carbonate, 90.93; magnesium, .75; iron, 1.37; manganese, 4.34;
calcium sulphate, 2.30; calcium phosphate, .24 (R. T. Günther,
<i>Geog. Journ.</i> xiv. 517).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARANHÃO,<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Maranham</span> (Span. <i>Marañon</i>, the name given
to the upper Amazon), a northern state of Brazil, bounded
N. by the Atlantic, E. and S.E. by Piauhy, S.W. and W. by
Goyaz and Pará. Area, 177,569 sq. m.; pop. (1890), 430,854;
(1900), 499,308. The coastal zone and the north-west corner of
the state belong to the Amazon valley region, being a heavily
forested plain traversed by numerous rivers. The eastern and
southern parts, however, belong to the lower terraces of the great
Brazilian plateau, broken by eroded river-courses between which
are high open plains. There are no true mountain ranges in
Maranhão, those indicated on the maps being only plateau
escarpments marking either its northern margin or the outlines
of river valleys. The climate is hot, and the year is divided into
a wet and dry season, extreme humidity being characteristic
of the former. The heat, however, is greatly modified on the
coast by the south-east trade winds, and the climate is generally
considered healthy, though beri-beri and eruptive diseases are
common on the coast. The coast itself is broken and dangerous,
there being many small indentations, which are usually masked
by islands or shoals. The largest of these are the Bay of Tury-assú,
facing which is the island of São João, and several others of
small size, and the contiguous bays of São Marcos and São José,
between which is the large island of Maranhão. The rivers of
the state all flow northward to the Atlantic and a majority
of them have navigable channels. The Parnahyba forms the
eastern boundary of Maranhão, but it has one large tributary,
the Balsas, entirely within the state. A part of the western
boundary is formed by the Tocantins, and another part by the
Gurupy, which separates the state from Pará. The principal
rivers of the state are the Maracassumé and Tury-assú, the
Mearim and its larger tributaries (the Pindaré, Grajahú, Flôres
and Corda) which discharge into the Bay of São Marcos, and the
Itapicurú and Monim which discharge into the Bay of São José.
Like the Amazon, the Mearim has a <i>pororoca</i> or bore in its lower
channel, which greatly interferes with navigation. There are a
number of small lakes in the state, some of which are, apparently,
merely reservoirs for the annual floods of the rainy season.</p>

<p>The principal industries of Maranhão are agricultural, the
river valleys and coastal zone being highly fertile and being
devoted to the cultivation of sugar-cane, cotton, rice, coffee,
tobacco, mandioca and a great variety of fruits. The southern
highlands, however, are devoted to stock-raising, which was once
an important industry. Troublesome insects, vampire bats,
and the failure to introduce new blood into the degenerated
herds, are responsible for its decline. Agriculture has also
greatly declined, the state producing for export only a comparatively
small quantity of cotton, rice, sugar and <i>aguardiente</i>.
Besides São Luiz, the capital of the state, the principal towns,
with the population of their municipal districts in 1890, are:
Caxias (19,443), Alcantara (4730), Carolina (7266), Grajahú
(11,704), Tury-assú (8983) and Viana (9965).</p>

<p>The coast of Maranhão was first discovered by Pinzon in 1500,
but it was included in the Portuguese grant of captaincies in
1534. The first European settlement, however, was made by a
French trading expedition under Jacques Riffault, of Dieppe, in
1594, who lost two of his three vessels in the vicinity of the
island of Maranhão, and left a part of his men on that island
when he returned home. Subsequently Daniel de la Rivardière
was sent to report on the place, and was then commissioned by
the French crown to found a colony on the island; this was done
in 1612. The French were expelled by the Portuguese in 1615,
and the Dutch held the island from 1641 to 1644. In 1621
Ceará, Maranhão and Pará were united and called the &ldquo;Estado
do Maranhão,&rdquo; which was made independent of the southern
captaincies. Ceará was subsequently detached, but the &ldquo;state&rdquo;
of Maranhão remained independent until 1774, when it again
became subject to the colonial administration of Brazil. Maranhão
did not join in the declaration of independence of 1822, but
in the following year the Portuguese were driven out by Admiral
Lord Cochrane and the province became a part of the new empire
of Brazil.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARANO<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (accursed or banned), a term applied to Jewish
Christians in Spain. Converted to Roman Catholicism under
compulsion, these &ldquo;New Christians&rdquo; often continued to observe
Jewish rites in their homes, as the Inquisition records
attest. It was in fact largely due to the Maranos that the Spanish
Inquisition was founded. The Maranos made rapid strides in
prosperity, and &ldquo;accumulated honours, wealth and popular
hatred&rdquo; (Lea, <i>History of the Spanish Inquisition</i>, i. 125). This
was one of the causes that led to the expulsion of the Jews from
Spain in 1492. Maranos emigrated to various countries, but
many remained in the Peninsula. Subsequently distinguished
individuals left home for more tolerant lands. The Jewish
community in London was refounded by Maranos in the first
half of the 17th century. Hamburg commerce, too, owed
much to the enterprise of Portuguese Maranos. In Amsterdam
many Maranos found asylum; Spinoza was descended from
such a family. There are still remnants of Marano families in
Portugal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARASH<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (anc. <i>Germanicia-Marasion</i>), the chief town of a
sanjak of the same name in the Aleppo vilayet, altitude 2600 ft.
situated E. of the Jihan river, at the foot of Mt Taurus. The
sanjak lies almost wholly in Mt Taurus, and includes the Armenian
town of Zeitun. Marash is prosperous, and has a large trade
in Kurd carpets and embroideries. The climate is good, except
in summer. Of the population (50,000) about half are Turkish-speaking
Armenians. There are a college, church and schools
belonging to the American mission, a native Protestant church
and a Jesuit establishment. The site, which lies near the
mouths of the three main passes over the eastern Taurus&mdash;viz.
those descending from Geuksun (Cocysus), Albistan-Yarpuz
(Arabissus), and Malatia (Melitene)&mdash;is shown to have had early
importance, not only by the occurrence of <i>Marasi</i> in Assyrian
inscriptions, but by the discovery of several &ldquo;Hittite&rdquo; monuments
on the spot. These, said to have been unearthed, for the
most part, near the Kirk Geuz spring above the modern town,
are now in Constantinople and America, and include an inscribed
lion, once built into the wall of the citadel known in the middle
ages as al-Marwani, and several <i>stelae</i>. No more is known of the
place until it appears as Germanicia-Caesarea, striking imperial
coins with the head of L. Verus (middle of 2nd cent. <span class="scs">A.D.</span>). The
identification of Marash with Germanicia has been disputed, but
successfully defended by Sir W. M. Ramsay; and it is borne out
by the Armenian name <i>Kermanig</i>, which has been given to the
place since at least the 12th century. Before the Roman period
Marash doubtless shared the fortunes of the Seleucid kingdom of
Commagene. <i>Germanicia-Marasion</i> played a great part in
Byzantine border warfare: Heraclius was there in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 640; but
before 700 it had passed into Saracen hands and been rebuilt by
the caliph Moawiya. During the 8th and 9th centuries, when
the direct pass from Cocysus came into military use, Marasion
(the older name had returned into general use) was often the
Byzantine objective and was more than once retaken; but after
770, when Mansur incorporated it in &ldquo;Palestine&rdquo; it remained
definitely in Moslem power and was refortified by Harun-al-Rashid.
It was seized by the crusaders after their march across
Mt Taurus, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1097, became an important town of Lesser
Armenia and was taken by the Seljuks in 1147. In the 16th
century it was added to the Osmanli Empire by Selim I. Marash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page669" id="page669"></a>669</span>
passed with the rest of Syria into Egyptian hands in 1832, and in
1839 received fugitives from the defeat of Nizib, among whom
was Moltke. Ibrahim Pasha was encamped near it when directed
by his father, at the bidding of the powers, to stay his further
advance. Since its reversion to Ottoman power (1840) the history
of Marash has been varied only by Armenian troubles, largely
connected with the fortunes of Zeitun, for the reduction of which
place it has more than once been used as a base. There was
less disturbance there in 1895-1896 than in other north Syrian
towns.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARAT, JEAN PAUL<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (1743-1793), French revolutionary
leader, eldest child of Jean Paul Marat, a native of Cagliari
in Sardinia, and Louise Cabrol of Geneva, was born at Boudry,
in the principality of Neuchâtel, on the 24th of May 1743. His
father was a designer, who had abandoned his country and his
religion, and married a Swiss Protestant. On his mother&rsquo;s death
in 1759 Marat set out on his travels, and spent two years at
Bordeaux in the study of medicine, whence he moved to Paris,
where he made use of his knowledge of his two favourite sciences,
optics and electricity, to subdue an obstinate disease of the eyes.
After some years in Paris he went to Holland, and then on to
London, where he practised his profession. In 1773 he made
his first appearance as an author with a <i>Philosophical Essay
on Man</i>. The book shows a wonderful knowledge of English,
French, German, Italian and Spanish philosophers, and directly
attacks Helvetius, who had in his <i>De l&rsquo;esprit</i> declared a knowledge
of science unnecessary for a philosopher. Marat declares
that physiology alone can solve the problems of the connexion
between soul and body, and proposes the existence of a nervous
fluid as the true solution. In 1774 he published <i>The Chains of
Slavery</i>, which was intended to influence constituencies to return
popular members, and reject the king&rsquo;s friends. Its author
declared later that it procured him an honorary membership of
the patriotic societies of Carlisle, Berwick and Newcastle. He
remained devoted to his profession, and in 1775 published in
London a little <i>Essay on Gleets</i>, and in Amsterdam a French
translation of the first two volumes of his <i>Essay on Man</i>. In
this year he visited Edinburgh, and on the recommendation of
certain Edinburgh physicians was made an M. D. of St Andrews.
On his return to London he published an <i>Enquiry into the Nature,
Cause, and Cure of a Singular Disease of the Eyes</i>, with a dedication
to the Royal Society. In the same year there appeared the
third volume of the French edition of the <i>Essay on Man</i>, which
reached Ferney, and exasperated Voltaire, by its onslaught on
Helvetius, into a sharp attack which only made the young author
more conspicuous. His fame as a clever doctor was now great,
and on the 24th of June 1777, the comte d&rsquo;Artois, afterwards
Charles X. of France, made him by brevet physician to his guards
with 2000 livres a year and allowances.</p>

<p>Marat was soon in great request as a court doctor among the
aristocracy; and even Brissot, in his <i>Mémoires</i>, admits his influence
in the scientific world of Paris. The next years were much
occupied with scientific work, especially the study of heat, light
and electricity, on which he presented memoirs to the Académie
des Sciences, but the academicians were horrified at his temerity
in differing from Newton, and, though acknowledging his industry,
would not receive him among them. His experiments
greatly interested Benjamin Franklin, who used to visit him
and Goethe always regarded his rejection by the academy as
a glaring instance of scientific despotism. In 1780 he had
published at Neuchâtel a <i>Plan de législation criminelle</i>, founded
on the principles of Beccaria. In April 1786 he resigned his
court appointment. The results of his leisure were in 1787 a
new translation of Newton&rsquo;s <i>Optics</i>, and in 1788 his <i>Mémoires
académiques, ou nouvelles découvertes sur la lumière</i>.</p>

<p>His scientific life was now over, his political life was to begin;
in the notoriety of that political life his great scientific and
philosophical knowledge was to be forgotten, the high position
he had given up denied, and he himself scoffed at as an
ignorant charlatan, who had sold quack medicines about the
streets of Paris, and been glad to earn a few sous in the stables of
the comte d&rsquo;Artois. In 1788 the notables had met, and advised
the assembling of the states-general. The elections were the
cause of a flood of pamphlets, of which one, <i>Offrande à la patrie</i>,
was by Marat, and, though now forgotten, dwelt on much the
same points as the famous brochure of the Abbé Siéyès: <i>Qu&rsquo;est-ce
que le tiers état?</i> When the states-general met, Marat&rsquo;s
interest was as great as ever, and in June 1789 he published a
supplement to his <i>Offrande</i>, followed in July by <i>La constitution</i>, in
which he embodies his idea of a constitution for France, and in
September by his <i>Tableau des vices de la constitution d&rsquo;Angleterre</i>,
which he presented to the Assembly. The latter alone deserves
remark. The Assembly was at this time full of anglomaniacs,
who desired to establish in France a constitution similar to that
of England. Marat had seen that England was at this time
being ruled by an oligarchy using the forms of liberty, which,
while pretending to represent the country, was really being
gradually mastered by the royal power. His heart was now all
in politics; and he decided to start a paper. At first appeared
a single number of the <i>Moniteur patriote</i>, followed on the 12th
of September by the first number of the <i>Publiciste parisien</i>,
which on the 16th of September took the title of <i>L&rsquo;Ami du
peuple</i> and which he edited, with some interruptions, until the
21st of September 1792.</p>

<p>The life of Marat now becomes part of the history of the French
Revolution. From the beginning to the end he stood alone.
He was never attached to any party; the tone of his mind was
to suspect whoever was in power. About his paper, the incarnation
of himself, the first thing to be said is that the man always
meant what he said; no poverty, no misery or persecution, could
keep him quiet; he was perpetually crying, &ldquo;Nous sommes
trahis.&rdquo; Whoever suspected any one had only to denounce
him to the <i>Ami du peuple</i>, and the denounced was never let
alone till he was proved innocent or guilty. Marat began by
attacking the most powerful bodies in Paris&mdash;the Constituent
Assembly, the ministers, the corps municipal, and the court of
the Châtelet. Denounced and arrested, he was imprisoned
from the 8th of October to the 5th of November 1789. A second
time, owing to his violent campaign against Lafayette, he
narrowly escaped arrest and had to flee to London (Jan. 1790).
There he wrote his <i>Dénonciation contre Necker</i>, and in May dared
to return to Paris and continue the <i>Ami du peuple</i>. He was
embittered by persecution, and continued his vehement attacks
against all in power, and at last, after the day of the Champs
du Mars (July 17, 1790), against the king himself. All this time
he was in hiding in cellars and sewers, where he was attacked by
a horrible skin disease, tended only by the woman Simonne
Evrard, who remained true to him. The end of the Constituent
Assembly he heard of with joy and with bright hopes for the
future, soon dashed by the behaviour of the Legislative Assembly.
When almost despairing, in December 1791, he fled once more
to London, where he wrote his <i>Ecole du citoyen</i>. In April 1792,
summoned again by the Cordeliers&rsquo; Club, he returned to Paris,
and published No. 627 of the <i>Ami</i>. The war was now the
question, and Marat saw clearly that it was to serve the purposes
of the Royalists and the Girondins, who thought of themselves
alone. Again denounced, Marat had to remain in hiding until
the 10th of August. The early days of the war being unsuccessful,
the proclamation of the duke of Brunswick excited all
hearts; who could go to save France on the frontiers and leave
Paris in the hands of his enemies? Marat, like Danton, foresaw
the massacres of September. After the events of the 10th of
August he took his seat at the commune, and demanded a
tribunal to try the Royalists in prison. No tribunal was formed,
and the massacres in the prisons were the inevitable result. In
the elections to the Convention, Marat was elected seventh out
of the twenty-four deputies for Paris, and for the first time took
his seat in an assembly of the nation. At the declaration of the
republic, he closed his <i>Ami du peuple</i>, and commenced, on the
25th, a new paper, the <i>Journal de la république française</i>, which
was to contain his sentiments as its predecessor had done, and
to be always on the watch. In the Assembly Marat had no party;
he would always suspect and oppose the powerful, refuse power
for himself. After the battle of Valmy, Dumouriez was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page670" id="page670"></a>670</span>
greatest man in France; he could almost have restored the
monarchy; yet Marat did not fear to denounce him in placards
as a traitor.</p>

<p>His unpopularity in the Assembly was extreme, yet he insisted
on speaking on the question of the king&rsquo;s trial, declared it unfair
to accuse Louis for anything anterior to his acceptance of <i>the</i>
constitution, and though implacable towards the king, as the
one man who must die for the people&rsquo;s good, he would not allow
Malesherbes, the king&rsquo;s counsel, to be attacked in his paper, and
speaks of him as a &ldquo;sage et respectable vieillard.&rdquo; The king
dead, the months from January to May 1793 were spent in an
unrelenting struggle between Marat and the Girondins. Marat
despised the ruling party because they had suffered nothing for
the republic, because they talked too much of their feelings and
their antique virtue, because they had for their own virtues
plunged the country into war; while the Girondins hated Marat
as representative of that rough red republicanism which would
not yield itself to a Roman republic, with themselves for tribunes,
orators and generals. The Girondins conquered at first in the
Convention, and ordered that Marat should be tried before the
Revolutionary Tribunal. But their victory ruined them, for on
the 24th of April Marat was acquitted, and returned to the Convention
with the people at his back. The fall of the Girondins on
the 31st of May was a triumph for Marat. But it was his last.
The skin disease he had contracted in the subterranean haunts
was rapidly closing his life; he could only ease his pain by sitting
in a warm bath, where he wrote his journal, and accused the
Girondins, who were trying to raise France against Paris. Sitting
thus on the 13th of July he heard in the evening a young woman
begging to be admitted to see him, saying that she brought news
from Caen, where the escaped Girondins were trying to rouse
Normandy. He ordered her to be admitted, asked her the names
of the deputies then at Caen, and, after writing their names,
said, &ldquo;They shall be soon guillotined,&rdquo; when the young girl,
whose name was Charlotte Corday (<i>q.v.</i>), stabbed him to the
heart.</p>

<p>His death caused a great commotion at Paris. The Convention
attended his funeral, and placed his bust in the hall where it
held its sessions. Louis David painted &ldquo;Marat Assassinated,&rdquo;
and a veritable cult was rendered to the Friend of the People,
whose ashes were transferred to the Panthéon with great pomp
on the 21st of September 1794&mdash;to be cast out again in virtue
of the decree of the 8th of February 1795.</p>

<p>Marat&rsquo;s name was long an object of execration on account
of his insistence on the death penalty. He stands in history as
a bloodthirsty monster, yet in judging him one must remember
the persecutions he endured and the terrible disease from which
he suffered.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARATHI<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> (properly <i>Mar&#257;th&#299;</i>),<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the name of an important
Indo-Aryan language spoken in western and central India. In
1901 the number of speakers was 18,237,899, or about the same
as the population of Spain. Marathi occupies an irregular triangular
area of approximately 100,000 sq.m., having its apex about
the district of Balaghat in the Central Provinces, and for its base
the western coast of the peninsula from Daman on the Gulf of
Cambay in the north to Karwar on the open Arabian Sea in the
south. It covers parts of two provinces of British India&mdash;Bombay
and the Central Provinces (including Berar)&mdash;with numerous
settlers in Central India and Madras, and is also the principal
language of Portuguese India and of the north-western portion
of His Highness the Nizam&rsquo;s dominions. The standard form
of speech is that of Poona in Bombay, and, in its various dialects
it covers the larger part of that province, in which it is the
vernacular of more than eight and a half millions of people.</p>

<p>As explained in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan Languages</a></span>, there were
in ancient times two main groups of these forms of speech&mdash;one,
the language of the Midland, spoken in the country near the
Gangetic Doab, and the other, the languages of the so-called
&ldquo;Outer Band,&rdquo; containing the Midland on three sides, west,
east and south. The country to the south of the Midland, in
which members of this Outer group of languages were formerly
spoken, included the modern Rajputana and Gujarat, and
extended to the basin of the river Nerbudda, being bounded
on the south by the Vindhya hills. In the course of time the
population of the Midland expanded, and gradually occupied
this tract, reaching the sea in Gujarat. The language of the
Outer Band was thus forced farther afield. Its speakers crossed
the Vindhyas and settled in the central plateau of the Deccan
and on the Konkan coast. Here they came into contact with
speakers of the Dravidian languages of southern India. As
happened elsewhere in India, they retained their own Aryan
tongue, and gradually through the influence of their superior
civilization imposed it upon the aborigines, so that all the
inhabitants of this tract became the ancestors of the speakers
of modern Marathi.</p>

<p>In Rajputana and Gujarat the language (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gujarat</a></span>) is to
a certain extent mixed. Near the original Midland there are
few traces of the Outer language, but as we go farther and farther
away from that centre we find, as might be expected, the influence
of the Midland language becoming weaker and weaker, and
traces of the Outer language becoming more and more evident,
until in Gujarati we recognize several important survivals of the
old language once spoken by the earlier Aryan inhabitants.</p>

<p><i>Dialects.</i>&mdash;Besides the standard form of speech, there is only
one real dialect of Marathi, viz. Konkani (K&#333;nka&#7751;&#299;), spoken in
the country near Goa. There are also several local varieties,
and we may conveniently distinguish between the Marathi of
the Deccan, that of the Central Provinces (including Berar), and
that of the northern and central Konkan. In the southern part
of the district of Ratnagiri this latter Konkani variety of Marathi
gradually merges into the true Konkani dialect through a number
of intermediate forms of speech. There are also several broken
jargones, based upon Marathi, employed by aboriginal tribes
surviving in the hill country.</p>

<p><i>Relations with other Indo-Aryan Languages.</i>&mdash;Marathi has
to its north, in order from west to east, Gujarati, Rajasthani,
Western Hindi and Eastern Hindi. To its east and south it
has the Dravidian languages, Gondi, Telugu and Kanarese.
Elsewhere in India Aryan languages gradually fade away into
each other, so that it is impossible to fix any definite boundary
line between them. But this is not the case with Marathi. It
does not merge into any of the cognate neighbouring forms of
speech, but possesses a distinct linguistic frontier. A native
writer<a name="fa2b" id="fa2b" href="#ft2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a> says: &ldquo;The Gujarati language agrees very closely with
the languages of the countries lying to the north of it, because
the Gujarati people came from the north. If a native of Delhi,
Ajmere, Marwar, Mewar, Jaipur, &amp;c., comes into Gujarat, the
Gujarati people find no difficulty in understanding his language.
But it is very wonderful that when people from countries bordering
Gujarat on the south, as the Konkan, Maharashtra, &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page671" id="page671"></a>671</span>
(<i>i.e.</i> people speaking Marathi) come to Gujarat, the Gujarati
people do not in the least comprehend what they say.&rdquo; This
isolated character of Marathi is partly due to the barrier of the
Vindhya range which lies to its north, and partly to the fact that
none of the northern languages belongs now to the Outer Band,
but are in more or less close relationship to the language of the
Midland. There was no common ground either physical or
linguistic, upon which the colliding forms of speech could meet
on equal terms. Eastern Hindi is more closely related to Marathi
than the others, and in its case, in its bordering dialects, we
do find a few traces of the influence of Marathi&mdash;traces which
are part of the essence of the language, and not mere borrowed
waifs floating on the top of a sea of alien speech and not
absorbed by it.</p>

<p><i>Written Character.</i>&mdash;Marathi books are generally printed in
the well-known Nagari character (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sanskrit</a></span>), and this is also
used to a great extent in private transactions and correspondence.
In the Maratha country it is known as the <i>B&#257;lb&#333;dh</i>
(&ldquo;teachable to children,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;easy&rdquo;) character. A cursive
form of Nagari called <i>M&#333;&#7693;&#299;</i>, or &ldquo;twisted,&rdquo; is also employed as
a handwriting. It is said to have been invented in the
17th century by Balaji Avaji, the secretary of the celebrated
Sivaji. Its chief merit is that each word can be written as a
whole without lifting the pen from the paper, a feat which is
impossible in the case of Nagari.<a name="fa3b" id="fa3b" href="#ft3b"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p><i>Origin of the Language.</i>&mdash;The word &ldquo;Mar&#257;&#7789;h&#299;&rdquo; signifies (the
language) of the Maratha country. It is the modern form of
the Sanskrit <i>M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;</i>, just as &ldquo;Mar&#257;&#7789;h&#257;&rdquo; represents the old
<i>M&#257;h&#257;-r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra</i>, or Great Kingdom. <i>M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;</i> was the name
given by Sanskrit writers to the particular form of Prakrit
spoken in M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra, the great Aryan kingdom extending southwards
from the Vindhya range to the Kistna, broadly corresponding
to the southern part of the Bombay Presidency and to
the state of Hyderabad. As pointed out in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>
this M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; early obtained literary pre-eminence in India,
and became the form of Prakrit employed as the language not
only of lyric poetry but also of the formal epic (<i>k&#257;vya</i>). Dramatic
works were composed in it, and it was the vehicle of the
non-canonical scriptures of the Jaina religion. The oldest work
in the language of which we have any knowledge is the <i>Sattasa&#299;</i>,
or Seven Centuries of verses, compiled at Prati&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;na, on the
G&#333;d&#257;var&#299;, the capital of King H&#257;la, at some time between the
3rd and 7th centuries <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Prati&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;na is the modern Paithan
in the Aurangabad district of Hyderabad, and that city was for
long famous as a centre of literary composition. In later times
the political centre of gravity was changed to Poona, the language
of which district is now accepted as the standard of the best
Marathi.</p>

<p><i>General Character of the Language.</i>&mdash;In the following account
of the main features of Marathi, the reader is presumed to be
familiar with the leading facts stated in the articles <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan
Languages</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>. In the Prakrit stage of the Indo-Aryan
languages we can divide the Prakrits into two well-defined
groups, an Inner, &#346;auras&#275;n&#299; and its connected dialects
on the one hand, and an Outer, M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;, Ardham&#257;gadh&#299;,
and M&#257;gadh&#299; with their connected dialects on the other. These
two groups differed in their phonetic laws, in their systems of
declension and conjugation, in vocabulary, and in general character.<a name="fa4b" id="fa4b" href="#ft4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
In regard to the last point reference may be made
to the frequent use of meaningless suffixes, such as -<i>alla</i>, -<i>illa</i>,
-<i>ulla</i>, &amp;c., which can be added, almost <i>ad libitum</i> to any noun,
adjective or particle in M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; and Ardham&#257;gadh&#299;, but
which are hardly ever met in &#346;auras&#275;n&#299;. These give rise to
numerous secondary forms of words, used, it might be said, in
a spirit of playfulness, which give a distinct flavour to the whole
language. Similarly the late Mr Beames (<i>Comparative Grammar</i>,
i. 103) well describes Marathi as possessing &ldquo;a very decided
individuality, a type quite its own, arising from its comparative
isolation for so many centuries.&rdquo; Elsewhere (p. 38) he uses
language which would easily well apply to M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; Prakrit
when he says, &ldquo;Marathi is one of those languages which we
may call playful&mdash;it delights in all sorts of jingling formations,
and has struck out a larger quantity of secondary and tertiary
words, diminutives, and the like, than any of the cognate
tongues,&rdquo; and again (p. 52):&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;In Marathi we see the results of the Pandit&rsquo;s file applied to a
form of speech originally possessed of much natural wildness and
licence. The hedgerows have been pruned and the wild briars
and roses trained into order. It is a copious and beautiful language,
second only to Hindi. It has three genders, and the same elaborate
preparation of the base as Sindhi, and, owing to the great corruption
which has taken place in its terminations, the difficulty of determining
the gender of nouns is as great in Marathi as in German. In
fact, if we were to institute a parallel in this respect, we might
appropriately describe Hindi as the English, Marathi as the German
of the Indian group&mdash;Hindi having cast aside whatever could
possibly be dispensed with, Marathi having retained whatever has
been spared by the action of time. To an Englishman Hindi
commends itself by its absence of form, and the positional structure
of its sentences resulting therefrom; to our High-German cousins
the Marathi, with its fuller array of genders, terminations, and
inflexions, would probably seem the completer and finer language.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span> it is explained that the literary Prakrits
were not the direct parents of the modern Indo-Aryan vernaculars.
Each Prakrit had first to pass through an intermediate
stage&mdash;that of the Apabhram&#347;a&mdash;before it took the form current
at the present day. While we know a good deal about M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;
and very little about &#346;auras&#275;n&#299; Prakrit, the case is reversed
in regard to their respective Apabhram&#347;as. The &#346;auras&#275;n&#257;
Apabhram&#347;a is the only one concerning which we have definite
information. Although it would be quite possible to reason
from analogy, and thus to obtain what would be the corresponding
forms of M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra Apabhram&#347;a, we should often be
travelling upon insecure ground, and it is therefore advisable
to compare Marathi, not with the Apabhram&#347;a from which it
is immediately derived, but with its grandmother, M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;
Prakrit. We shall adopt this course, so far as possible, in the
following pages.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Vocabulary.</i>&mdash;In the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan Languages</a></span> it is explained
that, allowing for phonetic development, the vocabulary
of &#346;auras&#275;n&#299; Prakrit was the same as that of Sanskrit, but that the
farther we go from the Midland, the more examples we meet of a new
class of words, the so-called <i>d&#275;&#347;yas</i>, descendants of the old Primary
Prakrits spoken outside the Midland, and strange to Sanskrit.
M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; Prakrit, the most independent of the Outer languages,
was distinguished by the large proportion of these <i>d&#275;&#347;yas</i> found in
its vocabulary, and the same is consequently the case in Marathi.
The Brahmins of the Maratha country have always had a great
reputation for learning, and their efforts to create a literary language
out of their vernacular took, as in other parts of India, the direction
of borrowing <i>tatsamas</i> from Sanskrit, to lend what they considered
to be dignity to their sentences. But the richness of the language in
<i>d&#275;&#347;ya</i> words has often rendered such borrowing unnecessary, and has
saved Marathi, although the proportion of <i>tatsamas</i> to <i>tadbhavas</i><a name="fa5b" id="fa5b" href="#ft5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a> in
the language is more than sufficiently high, from the fate of the
Pandit-ridden literary Bengali, in which 80 to 90% of the vocabulary
is pure Sanskrit. There is indeed a tradition of stylistic chastity
in the Maratha country from the earliest times, and even Sanskrit
writers contrasted the simple elegance of the Deccan (or <i>Vaidarbh&#299;</i>)
style with the flowery complexity of eastern India.</p>

<p>The proportion of Persian and, through Persian, of Arabic words
in the Marathi vocabulary is comparatively low, when compared
with, say, Hindostani. The reason is, firstly, the predominance
in the literary world of these learned Brahmins, and, secondly, the
fact that the Maratha country was not conquered by the Mussulmans
till a fairly late period, nor was it so thoroughly occupied by them
as were Sind, the Punjab, and the Gangetic valley.</p>

<p><i>Phonetics.</i><a name="fa6b" id="fa6b" href="#ft6b"><span class="sp">6</span></a>&mdash;In the standard dialect the vowels are the same as
in Sanskrit, but <i>&#7771;</i> and <i>&#7735;</i> only appear in words borrowed directly from
that language (<i>tatsamas</i>). Final short vowels (<i>a</i>, <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>) have all
disappeared in prose pronunciation, except in a few local dialects,
and final <i>i</i> and <i>u</i> are not even written. On the other hand, in the
Nagari character, the non-pronunciation of a final <i>a</i> is not indicated.
After an accented syllable a medial <i>a</i> is pronounced very lightly, even
when the accent is not the main accent of the word. Thus, if we
indicate the main accent by &rsquo;, and subsidiary accents (equivalent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page672" id="page672"></a>672</span>
to the Hebrew <i>methegh</i>) by `, then the word <i>kárawat</i>, a saw, is pronounced
<i>kár<span class="sp">a</span>wat</i>; and <i>kà&#7735;aká&#7735;a&#7751;&#7877;</i>, to be agitated, is pronounced
<i>kà&#7735;<span class="sp">a</span>ká&#7735;<span class="sp">a</span>&#7751;</i>&#7877;. In Konkani the vowel <i>a</i> assumes the sound of o in &ldquo;hot,&rdquo;
a sound which is also heard in the language of Bengal. In dialectic
speech <i>&#275;</i> is often interchangeable with short or long <i>a</i>, so that the
standard <i>s&#257;&#7749;git<span class="sp">a</span>l&#7877;</i>, it was said, may appear as
<i>s&#257;&#7749;git<span class="sp">a</span>l&#257;</i> or <i>s&#257;&#7749;git<span class="sp">a</span>l&#7851;</i>.
The vowels <i>&#275;</i> and <i>&#333;</i> are apparently always long in the standard dialect,
thus following Sanskrit; but in Konkani there is a short and a
long form of each vowel. Very probably, although the distinction is
not observed in writing, and has not been noticed by native scholars,
these vowels are also pronounced short in the standard dialect under
the circumstances to be now described. When a long <i>&#257;</i>, <i>&#299;</i> or <i>&#363;</i>
precedes an accented syllable it is usually shortened. In the case
of <i>&#257;</i> the shortening is not indicated by the spelling, but the written
long <i>&#257;</i> is pronounced short like the <i>&#259;</i> in the Italian <i>ballo</i>. Thus, the
dative of <i>p&#299;k</i>, a ripe crop, is <i>pik&#257;&#775;s</i>, and that of <i>h&#257;t</i>, a hand, is <i>h&#257;t&#257;&#775;s</i>,
pronounced <i>h&#259;t&#257;&#775;s</i>. Almost the only compound consonants which
survived in the Prakrit stage were double letters, and in M. these are
usually simplified, the preceding vowel being lengthened in compensation.
Thus, the Prakrit <i>kann&#333;</i> becomes <i>k&#257;n</i>, an ear; Pr. <i>bhikkh&#257;</i>
becomes <i>bh&#299;k</i>, alms; and Pr. <i>putt&#333;</i> becomes  <i>p&#363;t</i>, a son. In the
Pi&#347;&#257;ca (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan Languages</a></span>) and other languages of north-western
India it is not usual to lengthen the vowel in compensation,
and the same tendency is observable in Konkani, which, it may
be remarked, appears to contain many relics of the old Prakrit
(Saur&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;) spoken in the Gujarat country before the invasion from
the Midland. Thus, in Konkani, we have <i>put</i> as well as <i>p&#363;t</i>,
while the word corresponding to the Pr. <i>ekk&#333;</i>, one, is <i>ek</i> as well as
the standard <i>&#275;k</i>.</p>

<p>On the whole, the consonantal system is much the same as in other
Indian languages. Nasalization of long vowels is very common,
especially in Konkani. In this article it is indicated by the sign ~ placed
over the affected vowel. The palatals are pronounced as in
Skr. in words borrowed from that language or from Hindostani, and
also in Marathi <i>tadbhavas</i> before <i>i</i>, <i>&#299;</i>, <i>&#275;</i> or <i>y</i>. Thus, <i>ca&#7751;&#7693;</i> (<i>tatsama</i>),
fierce; <i>jam&#257;</i> (Hindostani), collected; <i>cikhal</i> (M. <i>tadbhava</i>), mud.
In other cases they are pronounced <i>ts</i>, <i>tsh</i>, <i>dz</i>, <i>dzh</i> respectively.
Thus <i>ts&#257;kar</i> (for <i>c&#257;kar</i>), a servant; <i>dz&#257;&#7751;&#7877;</i> (for <i>j&#257;&#7751;&#7877;</i>), to go. There are
two <i>s</i>-sounds in the standard dialect which are very similarly distinguished.
<i>&#346;</i>, pronounced like an English <i>sh</i>, is used before <i>i</i>, <i>&#299;</i>, <i>&#275;</i>
or <i>y</i>; and <i>s</i>, as in English &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; elsewhere. Thus, <i>&#347;imph&#299;</i>, a caste-name;
<i>&#347;&#299;l</i>, a stone; <i>&#347;&#275;t</i>, a field; <i>&#347;y&#257;m</i>, dark blue; but <i>s&#257;p</i>, a snake;
<i>sum&#257;r</i> (Persian <i>shum&#257;r</i>), an estimate; <i>str&#299;</i>, a woman. In the dialects
<i>s</i> is practically the only sibilant used, and that is changed by the
vulgar speakers of Konkani to <i>h</i> (again as in north-western India).
Aspirated letters show a tendency to lose their aspiration, especially
in Konkani. Thus, <i>bh&#299;k</i> (for <i>bh&#299;kh</i>), alms, quoted above; <i>h&#257;t</i> (Pr.
<i>hatth&#333;</i>), a hand. In Konkani we have words such as <i>boi&#7751;</i>, a sister,
against standard <i>bhain</i>; <i>g&#275;r</i>, standard <i>ghar&#299;&#775;</i>, in a house; <i>&#257;m&#299;</i>,
standard <i>&#257;mh&#299;</i>, we. Here again we have agreement with north-western
India. Generally speaking Marathi closely follows M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#257;
when that differs from the Prakrits of other parts of India.
Thus we have Skr. <i>vrajati</i>, M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; <i>vaccai</i> (instead of <i>vajjai</i>), he
goes; Konkani <i>vots&#363;</i>, to go; Sauras&#275;n&#299; <i>genhiduim</i>, M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; <i>ghettu&#7745;</i>,
to take; Marathi <i>gh&#275;t<span class="sp">a</span>l&#7877;</i>, taken. There is similarly both in Marathi
and M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; a laxness in distinguishing between cerebral and
dental letters (which again reminds us of north-western India). Thus,
Skr. <i>da&#347;ati</i>, M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; <i>&#7693;asai</i>, he bites; M. <i>&#7693;&#257;s<span class="sp">a</span>&#7751;&#7877;</i> to bite; Skr.
<i>dahati</i>, M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; <i>&#7693;ahai</i>, he burns; M. <i>&#7693;&#257;dz<span class="sp">a</span>&#7751;&#7877;</i>, to be hot; Skr.
<i>gardabhas</i>; &#346;auras&#275;n&#299; <i>gaddah&#333;</i>; Hindostani <i>gadh&#257;</i>; but M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;
<i>ga&#7693;&#7693;ah&#333;</i>; M. <i>g&#257;&#7693;hav</i>, an ass; and so many others. In M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;
every <i>n</i> becomes <i>&#7751;</i>, but in Jaina MSS. when the <i>n</i> was initial or
doubled it remained unchanged. A similar rule is followed regarding
<i>l</i> and the cerebral <i>&#7735;</i> common in Vedic Sanskrit, in MSS. coming from
southern India, and, according to the grammarians, also in the
Pi&#347;&#257;ca dialects of the north-west. In M. a Pr. double <i>nn</i> or <i>ll</i> is
simplified, according to the usual rule, to <i>n</i> or <i>l</i> respectively, with
lengthening of the preceding vowel in compensation. Both <i>&#7751;</i> and
<i>&#7735;</i> are of frequent occurrence in M., but only as medial letters, and
then only when they represent <i>&#7751;</i> or <i>&#7735;</i> in the Pr. stage. When
the letter is initial or represents a double <i>nn</i> or <i>ll</i> of Pr. it is
always <i>n</i> or <i>l</i> respectively, thus offering a striking testimony to
the accuracy of the Jaina and southern MSS. Thus, ordinary
M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; <i>&#7751;a</i>, but Jaina M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; <i>na</i>, M. na, not; M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;
(both kinds) <i>gha&#7751;&#333;</i>, M. <i>gha&#7751;</i>, dense;
M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; <i>so&#7751;&#7751;aa&#7745;</i>, Jaina
<i>sonnaa&#7745;</i>, M. <i>s&#333;n&#275;&#775;</i>, gold; M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; <i>k&#257;l&#333;</i>, time, southern MSS. of
the same <i>k&#257;l&#333;</i>, M. <i>k&#257;&#7735;</i>, time; M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; <i>callai</i>, M. <i>ts&#257;l&#275;</i>, he goes or
used to go. In some of the local dialects, following the Vedic practice,
we find <i>&#7735;</i> where <i>d</i> is employed elsewhere, as in (Berar) <i>gh&#333;&#7735;&#257;</i> for
<i>gh&#333;&#7693;&#257;</i>, a horse; and there are instances of this change occurring
even in M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299;; <i>e.g.</i> Skr. <i>ta&#7693;aga&#7745;</i>, M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; <i>ta&#7735;&#257;am</i>, M. <i>ta&#7735;&#7877;</i>,
a pond.</p>

<p>The Skr. compound consonant <i>jñ</i> is pronounced <i>dny</i> in the
standard dialect, but <i>gy</i> in the Konkan. Thus, Skr. <i>jñ&#257;na&#7745;</i> becomes
<i>dny&#257;n</i> or <i>gy&#257;n</i> according to locality.</p>

<p><i>Declension.</i>&mdash;Marathi and Gujarati are the only Indo-Aryan
languages which have retained the three genders, masculine,
feminine and neuter, of Sanskrit and Prakrit. In rural dialects of
Western Hindi and of Rajasthani sporadic instances of the neuter
gender have survived, but elsewhere the only example occurs in the
interrogative pronoun. In Marathi the neuter denotes not only
inanimate things but also animate beings when both sexes are
included, or when the sex is left undecided. Thus, <i>gh&#333;&#7693;&#7877;</i>, neut., a
horse, without regard to sex. In the Konkan the neuter gender is
further employed to denote females below the age of puberty, as in
<i>c&#275;&#7693;&#363;</i>, a girl. Numerous masculine and feminine words, however,
denote inanimate objects. The rules for distinguishing the gender
of such nouns are as complicated as in German, and must be
learned from the grammars. For the most part, but not always,
words follow the genders of their Skr. originals, and the abrasion
of terminations in the modern language renders it impossible to lay
down any complete set of rules on the subject. We may, however,
say that strong bases (see below) in <i>&#257;</i>&mdash;and these do not include
<i>tatsamas</i>&mdash;are masculine, and that the corresponding feminine and
neuter words end in <i>&#299;</i> and <i>&#7877;</i> respectively. Thus, <i>mul<span class="sp">a</span>g&#257;</i>, a son;
<i>mul<span class="sp">a</span>g&#299;</i>, a daughter; <i>mul<span class="sp">a</span>g&#7877;</i>, a child of so and so. As a further
guide we may say that sex is usually distinguished by the use
of the masculine and feminine genders, and that large and
powerful inanimate objects are generally masculine, while small,
delicate things are generally feminine. In the case of some
animals (as in our &ldquo;horse&rdquo; and &ldquo;mare&rdquo;) sex is distinguished by the
use of different words; <i>e.g.</i> <i>b&#333;ka&#7693;</i>, he-goat, and
<i>&#347;&#275;&#7735;&#299;</i>, a nanny-goat.</p>

<p>The nominative form of a <i>tadbhava</i> word is derived from the
nominative form in Sanskrit and Prakrit, but <i>tatsama</i> words are
generally borrowed in the form of the Sanskrit crude base. Thus,
Skr. crude base <i>m&#257;lin</i>, nom. sing, <i>m&#257;l&#299;</i>; Pr. nom. <i>m&#257;li&#333;</i> (<i>m&#257;&#7735;i&#333;</i>);
M. <i>m&#257;&#7735;&#299;</i> (<i>tadbhava</i>), a gardener; Skr. base <i>mati</i>-; nom. <i>matis</i>; M.
<i>mati</i> (<i>tatsama</i>). Some <i>tatsamas</i> are, however, borrowed in the nominative
form, as in Skr. <i>dhanin</i>, nom. <i>dhan&#299;</i>; M. <i>dhan&#299;</i>, a rich man.
In Prakrit the nominative singular of many masculine <i>tatsamas</i>
ended in <i>&#333;</i>. In the Apabhra&#7745;&#347;a stage this <i>&#333;</i> was weakened to <i>u</i>, and
in modern Marathi, under the general rule, this final short <i>u</i> was
dropped, the noun thus reverting as stated above to the form of the
Sanskrit crude base. But in old Marathi, the short u was still
retained. Thus, the Sanskrit <i>&#299;&#347;varas</i>, lord, became, as a Prakrit
<i>tatsama</i>, <i>&#299;&#347;var&#333;</i>, which in Apabhra&#7745;&#347;a took the form <i>&#299;&#347;varu</i>. The old
Marathi form was also <i>&#299;&#347;varu</i>, but in modern Marathi we have <i>&#299;&#347;var</i>.
<i>Tadbhavas</i> derived from Sanskrit bases in <i>a</i> are treated very similarly,
the termination being dropped in the modern language. Thus,
Skr. nom. masc. <i>kar&#7751;as</i>, Pr. <i>kann&#333;</i>, M. <i>k&#257;n</i>; Skr. nom. sing. fem.
<i>kha&#7789;v&#257;</i>, Pr. <i>kha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;</i>, M. <i>kh&#257;&#7789;</i>, a bed; Skr. nom. sing. neut. <i>g&#7771;ha&#7745;</i>, Pr.
<i>ghara&#7745;</i>, M. <i>ghar</i>, a house. Sometimes the Skr. nom. sing. fem. of
these nouns ends in <i>&#299;</i>, but this makes no difference, as in Skr. and
Pr. <i>cull&#299;</i>, M. <i>c&#363;l</i>, a fireplace. There is one important set of exceptions
to this rule. In the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span> attention is drawn to the frequent
use of pleonastic suffixes, especially of -(<i>a</i>)<i>ka</i>- (masc. and neut.),
-(<i>i</i>)<i>k&#257;</i>(fem.). This could in Sanskrit be added to any noun, whatever
the termination of the base might be. In Prakrit the <i>k</i> of this suffix,
being medial, was elided, so that we get forms like Skr. nom. sing.
masc. <i>gh&#333;&#7789;a-kas</i>, Pr. gh&#333;&#7693;a-&#333;, M. gh&#333;&#7693;&#257;, a horse; Skr. nom. sing. fem.
gh&#333;&#7789;i-k&#257;, Pr. <i>gh&#333;&#7693;i-&#257;</i>, M. <i>gh&#333;&#7693;&#299;</i>, a mare; Skr. <i>gh&#333;&#7789;a-ka&#7745;</i>, Pr. <i>gh&#333;&#7693;a-(y)am</i>,
M. <i>gh&#333;&#7693;e</i>, a horse (without distinction of sex). Such modern
forms made with this pleonastic suffix, and ending in <i>&#257;</i>, <i>&#299;</i> or <i>&#7877;</i> are
called &ldquo;strong forms,&rdquo; while all those made without it are called
&ldquo;weak forms.&rdquo; As a rule the fact that a noun is in a weak or a
strong form does not affect its meaning, but sometimes the use
of a masculine strong form indicates clumsiness or hugeness.
Thus <i>bh&#257;kar</i> (weak form) means &ldquo;bread,&rdquo; while <i>bh&#257;k<span class="sp">a</span>r&#257;</i> (strong
form) means &ldquo;a huge loaf of bread.&rdquo; The other pleonastic
suffixes mentioned under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span> are also employed in Marathi,
but usually with specific senses. Thus the suffix -<i>illa</i>- generally
forms adjectives, while -<i>&#7693;a-ka</i>- (in M. -<i>&#7693;&#257;</i>, fem. -<i>&#7693;&#299;</i>, neut. -<i>&#7693;&#7877;</i>) implies
contempt.</p>

<p>The synthetic declension of Sanskrit and Prakrit has been preserved
in Marathi more completely than in any other Indo-Aryan
language. While M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; Prakrit, like all others, passed through
the Apabhra&#7745;&#347;a stage in the course of its development, the conservative
character of the language retained even in that stage some
of the old pure M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; forms. In the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span> we have
seen how there gradually arose a laxity in distinguishing the cases.
In M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; the Sanskrit dative fell into almost entire disuse, the
genitive being used in its place, while in Apabhra&#7745;&#347;a the case
terminations become worn down to -<i>hu</i>, -<i>ho</i>, -<i>hi</i>, -<i>h&#299;</i> and -<i>h&#257;</i>, of which
-<i>hi</i> and -<i>h&#299;</i> were employed for several cases, both singular and plural.
There was also a marked tendency for these terminations to become
confused, so that in the earliest stages of most of the modern Indo-Aryan
vernaculars we find -<i>hi</i> freely employed for any oblique case
of the singular, and -<i>h&#299;</i> for any oblique case of the plural. Another
feature of Prakrit was the simplification of the complicated declensional
system of Sanskrit by assimilating it in all cases to the declension
of <i>a</i>-bases, corresponding to the first and second declensions in
Latin.</p>

<p>In the formation of the plural the Prakrit declensions are very
closely followed by Marathi. We shall confine our remarks to
<i>a</i>-bases, which may be either weak or strong forms, and of which the
feminine ends sometimes in <i>&#257;</i>, and sometimes in <i>&#299;</i>. In Prakrit the
nom. plur. of these nouns ends masc. <i>&#257;</i>, fem. <i>&#257;&#333;</i>, <i>&#299;&#333;</i>, neut. <i>&#257;i&#7745;</i>. We
thus get the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Several of the old synthetic cases have survived in Marathi,
especially in the antique form of the language preserved in poetry.
Most of them have fallen into disuse in the modern prose language.
We may note the following, some of which have preserved the
M&#257;h&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;r&#299; forms, while others are directly derived from the Apabhra&#7745;&#347;a
stage of the language. We content ourselves with giving
some of the synthetic cases of one noun, a weak neuter a-base, ghar,
a house.</p>

<p>As already stated, in Prakrit the genitive is employed instead of
the dative, and thus forms the basis of the Marathi dative singular.
The genitive plural is not used as a dative plural in Marathi, but it
is the basis of the plural general oblique case. The Marathi singular
general oblique case is really the same as the Marathi dative singular,
but in the standard form of speech when so used the final <i>s</i> is dropped,
<i>ghar&#257;s</i>, as a general oblique case, being only found in dialects.
This general oblique case is the result of the confusion of the
various oblique cases originally distinguished in Sanskrit and in
literary Prakrit. In Apabhra&#7745;&#347;a the genitive began to usurp the
function of all the other cases. It is obvious that if it were regularly
employed in so indeterminate a sense, it would give rise to great
confusion. Hence when it was intended to show clearly what particular
case was meant, it became usual to add, to this indeterminate
genitive, defining particles corresponding to the English &ldquo;of,&rdquo;
&ldquo;to,&rdquo; &ldquo;from,&rdquo; &ldquo;by,&rdquo; &amp;c., which, as in all Indo-Aryan languages
they follow the main word, are called &ldquo;postpositions.&rdquo; Before
dealing with these, it will be convenient to give the modern Marathi
synthetic declension of the commoner forms of nouns. The only
synthetic case which is now employed in prose is the dative, and this
can always be formed from the general oblique case by adding an s to
the end of the word. It is therefore not given in the following table.</p>

<p>The accusative is usually the same as the nominative, but when
definiteness is required the dative is employed instead. The termination
<i>n&#7877;</i>, with its plural <i>n&#299;&#x303;</i>, is, as explained in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gujarati</a></span>,
really the oblique form, by origin a locative, of the <i>n&#257;</i> or <i>n&#333;</i>,
employed in Gujarati to form the genitive. The suffix <i>n&#257;</i> of the
dative plural is derived from the same word. Here it is probably
a corruption of the Apabhra&#7745;&#347;a <i>n&#257;u</i> or <i>naho</i>. The postposition l&#257;
is probably a corruption of the Sanskrit <i>l&#257;bh&#275;</i>, Apabhra&#7745;&#347;a <i>lahi</i>, for
the benefit (of). As regards the ablative, we have
in old Marathi poetry a form corresponding to
<i>ghar&#257;hu-niy&#7851;</i>, which explains the derivation.
<i>Ghar&#257;hu</i> is a by-form of the Prakrit synthetic ablative
<i>ghar&#257;u</i>, to which <i>niy&#257;</i>, another oblique form of <i>n&#257;</i>,
is added to define the meaning. The locative
termination <span class="sp">~</span><i>t</i> is a contraction of the Pr. <i>ant&#333;</i>, Skr.
antar, within.</p>

<p>The genitive <i>ghar&#257;ts&#257;</i> is really an adjective meaning
&ldquo;belonging to the house,&rdquo; and agrees in
gender, number and case with the noun which is
possessed. Thus:</p>

<div class="list">
<p><i>m&#257;&#7735;y&#257;ts&#257; gh&#333;&#7693;&#257;</i>, the gardener&rsquo;s horse. <i>m&#257;&#7735;y&#257;c&#275;
gh&#333;&#7693;&#275;</i>, the gardener&rsquo;s horses.</p>

<p><i>m&#257;&#7735;y&#257;c&#299; gh&#333;&#7693;&#299;</i>, the gardener&rsquo;s mare. <i>m&#257;&#7735;y&#257;cy&#257; gh&#333;&#7693;y&#257;</i>, the
gardener&rsquo;s mares.</p>

<p><i>m&#257;&#7735;y&#257;c&#7877; gh&#333;&#7693;&#7877;</i>, the gardener&rsquo;s horse (neut.). <i>m&#257;&#7735;y&#257;c&#299;&#x303; gh&#333;&#7693;&#299;</i>, the
gardener&rsquo;s horses (neut.).</p>
</div>

<p>The suffix <i>ts&#257;</i>, <i>c&#299;</i>, <i>c&#7877;</i>, is derived from the Sanskrit suffix <i>tyakas</i>,
Pr. <i>ca&#333;</i>, which is used in much the same sense. In Sanskrit it may
be added either to the locative or to the unmodified base of the word
to which it is attached, thus, <i>gh&#333;&#7789;ak&#275;-tyakas</i> or <i>gh&#333;&#7789;aka-tyakas</i>.
Similarly in Marathi, while it is usually added to the general oblique
base, it may also be added to the unmodified noun, in which case it
has a more distinctly adjectival force. The use of <i>ts&#257;</i> has been
influenced by the fact that the Sanskrit word <i>k&#7771;tyas</i>, Pr. <i>kicca&#333;</i>, also
takes the same form in Marathi. As explained in the article
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hindostani</a></span>, synonyms of this word are used in other Indo-Aryan
languages to form suffixes of the genitive.<a name="fa7b" id="fa7b" href="#ft7b"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>Strong adjectives, including genitives, can be declined like substantives,
and agree with the qualified noun in gender, number and
case. When the substantive is in an oblique case, the adjective is
put into the general oblique form without any defining postposition,
which is added to the substantive alone. Weak adjectives are not
inflected in modern prose, but are inflected in poetry. As in other
Indo-Aryan languages, comparison is effected by putting the noun
with which comparison is made in the ablative case.</p>

<p>The pronouns closely follow the Prakrit originals. The origin
of all these is discussed in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hindostani</a></span>, and the account
need not be repeated here. As usual in these languages, there
is no pronoun of the third person, its place being supplied by the
demonstratives. The following are the principal pronominal
forms:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page674" id="page674"></a>674</span></p>

<p><i>m&#299;&#x303;</i>, I, instr. <i>m&#299;&#x303;</i>, <i>my&#257;</i>, dat. <i>mal&#257;</i>, obl. <i>madz</i>; <i>&#257;mh&#299;</i>, we, instr. <i>&#257;mh&#299;&#x303;</i>,
obl. <i>&#257;mh&#7851;</i>; <i>m&#257;dzh&#257;</i>, my, of me; <i>&#257;mts&#257;</i>, our, of us.</p>

<p><i>t&#363;&#x303;</i>, thou, instr. <i>t&#363;&#x303;</i>, <i>tw&#257;</i>, dat. <i>tul&#257;</i>, obl. <i>tudz</i>; <i>tumh&#299;</i>, you, instr.
<i>tumh&#299;&#x303;</i>, obl. <i>tumh&#7851;</i>; <i>tudzh&#257;</i>, thy, of thee; <i>tumts&#257;</i>, your, of you.</p>

<p><i>&#257;pan</i>, self, obl. <i>&#257;p<span class="sp">a</span>&#7751;a</i>, gen. <i>&#257;p<span class="sp">a</span>l&#257;</i>. This is also employed as an
honorific pronoun of the second person, and, in addition, to mean
&ldquo;we including you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>h&#257;</i>, this, fem., <i>h&#299;</i>, neut. <i>h&#7877;</i>; <i>t&#333;</i>, he, that, fem. <i>t&#299;</i>, neut. <i>t&#7877;</i>; <i>dz&#333;</i>, who,
fem., <i>j&#299;</i>, neut. <i>j&#7877;</i>.</p>

<p><i>k&#333;&#7751;</i>, who? <i>k&#257;y</i>, what? obl. <i>k&#257;&#347;a</i>; <i>k&#333;&#7751;&#299;</i>, any one; <i>k&#7851;h&#299;</i>, anything.</p>

<p>In all these the plural is employed honorifically instead of the
singular.</p>

<p><i>Conjugation.</i>&mdash;In Prakrit (<i>q.v.</i>) the complicated system of Sanskrit
conjugation had already disappeared, and all verbs fell into two
classes, the first, or <i>a</i>-, conjugation, and the second, or <i>&#275;</i>-, conjugation,
in which the <i>&#275;</i> represents the <i>aya</i> of the Sanskrit tenth conjugation
and of causal and denominative verbs. Marathi follows Prakrit
in this respect and has two conjugations. The first, corresponding
to the Prakrit <i>a</i>-class, as a rule consists of intransitive verbs, and the
second, corresponding to the <i>e</i>- or causal class, of transitive verbs,
but there are numerous exceptions. Verbs whose roots end in vowels
or in <i>h</i> belong partly to one and partly to the other conjugation.
These conjugations differ only in the present and past participles and
in the tenses formed from them. Here, in the first conjugation
an <i>a</i>, and in the second conjugation an <i>i</i>, is inserted between the base
and the termination.</p>

<p>The only original Prakrit tenses which have survived in Marathi
are the present and the imperative. The present has lost its original
meaning and is now a habitual past. It is also the base of the
Marathi future. These three tenses, the habitual past, the imperative
and the future, are conjugated as follows. They should
be compared with the corresponding forms in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>.
The verb selected is the root <i>u&#7789;h</i>, rise, of the first conjugation.</p>

<p>As in Rajasthani, Bihari and the Indo-Aryan language of Nepal
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pahari</a></span>), the future is formed by adding <i>l</i>, or in the first person
singular <i>n</i>, to the old present. In the second person singular the <i>l</i>
has been added to a form derived from the Pr. <i>u&#7789;&#7789;hasi</i>, which is also
the origin of the old present <i>u&#7789;h&#275;s</i>. Some scholars, however, see
in <i>u&#7789;ha&#347;&#299;</i> a derivation of the Prakrit future <i>u&#7789;&#7789;hihisi</i>, thou shalt
arise, and a confusion of the Prakrit present and future is quite
possible.</p>

<p>The remaining tenses are modern forms derived from the participles.

<p>The only form that requires notice is that of the conjunctive
participle. It is derived from the Apabhrar&#7745;&#347;a form <i>u&#7789;&#7789;hiu</i>, to which
the dative suffix <i>n</i> (old Marathi <i>ni</i>, <i>niy&#7851;</i>) has been added.</p>

<p>Various tenses are formed by adding personal suffixes to the
present, past or future passive participle. When the subject of the
verb is in the nominative the tense so formed agrees with it in gender,
number and person. We may note four such tenses: a present,
<i>u&#7789;h<span class="sp">a</span>t&#333;&#x303;</i>, I rise; a past, <i>u&#7789;h<span class="sp">a</span>l&#333;&#x303;</i>, I rose; past conditional, <i>u&#7789;h<span class="sp">a</span>t&#333;&#x303;</i>, had I
risen; and a subjunctive, <i>u&#7789;h&#257;w&#257;</i>, I should rise. In the present, the
terminations are relics of the verb substantive, and in the other tenses
of the personal pronouns. In these latter, as there is no pronoun
of the third person, the third persons have no termination, but are
simply the unmodified participle. We thus get the present and the
past conjugated as follows, with a masculine subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>The feminine and neuter forms differ from the above: thus,
<i>u&#7789;h<span class="sp">a</span>t&#275;s</i>, thou (fem.) risest; <i>u&#7789;h<span class="sp">a</span>l&#299;s</i>, thou (fem.) didst rise; and so on
for the other persons and for the neuter.</p>

<p>It will be observed that, in the case of transitive verbs, while the
present participle is active, the past and future passive participles
are passive in meaning. The same is the case with the future passive
participle of the intransitive verb. In tenses, therefore, formed from
these participles the sentence must be construed passively. The
subject must be put into the instrumental case, and the participle
inflected to agree with the object. If the object is not expressed,
or, as is sometimes the case, is expressed in the guise of a kind of ethic
dative, the participle is construed impersonally, and is employed in
the neuter form. Thus (present tense) <i>mul<span class="sp">a</span>g&#257;</i> (nom. masc.) <i>p&#333;th&#299;</i>
<i>v&#257;cit&#333;</i>, the boy reads a book, but (past tense) <i>mul<span class="sp">a</span>gy&#257;n&#7877;</i> (instrumental
<i>p&#333;th&#299;</i> (nom. fem.) <i>v&#257;cil&#299;</i> (fem.) the boy read a book, literally, by-the-boy
a-book was-read; or <i>mul<span class="sp">a</span>gy&#257;n&#7877; p&#333;th&#299;l&#257;</i> (dative) <i>v&#257;cil&#7877;</i> (neuter),
the boy read the book, literally, by-the-boy, with-reference-to-the-book,
it-(impersonal)-was-read. Similarly in the subjunctive
formed from the future passive participle, <i>mul<span class="sp">a</span>gy&#257;n&#7877; p&#333;th&#299; v&#257;c&#257;w&#299;</i>,
the boy should read a book (by-the-boy a-book is-to-be-read) or
<i>mul<span class="sp">a</span>gy&#257;n&#7877; p&#333;th&#299;l&#257; v&#257;c&#257;w&#7877;</i>, the boy should read the book [by-the-boy
with-reference-to-the-book, it (impersonal)-is-to-be-read]. As an
example of the subjunctive of an intransitive verb, we have <i>tw&#257;
u&#7789;h&#257;w&#7877;</i>, by-thee it-is-to-be-risen, thou shouldst rise. As in intransitive
verbs the passive sense is not so strong, in their case the tense
may also be used actively, as in <i>t&#363;&#x303; u&#7789;h&#257;w&#257;s</i>, thou shouldst rise, <i>lit.</i>,
thou (art) to-be-risen. It will be noted that when a participle is
used passively it takes no personal suffix.</p>

<p>We have seen that the present tense is formed by compounding
the present participle with the verb substantive. Further tenses
are similarly made by suffixing, without compounding, various tenses
of the verb substantive to the various participles. Thus <i>m&#299; u&#7789;hat
&#257;h&#7877;</i>, I am rising; <i>m&#299; u&#7789;hat h&#333;t&#333;&#x303;</i>, I was rising; <i>my&#257; u&#7789;h&#257;v&#7877; h&#333;t&#7877;</i> (impersonal
construction), I should have risen. In the case of tenses
formed from the past participle, the auxiliary is appended, not to
the participle, but to the past tense, as in <i>m&#299;&#x303; u&#7789;h<span class="sp">a</span>l&#333;&#x303; &#257;h&#275;</i>, I have risen;
<i>my&#257; m&#257;ril&#257; &#257;h&#275;</i> (personal passive construction) or <i>my&#257; m&#257;ril&#7877;</i> &#257;h&#275;
(impersonal passive construction), I have killed. Similarly <i>m&#299; u&#7789;h<span class="sp">a</span>l&#333;&#x303;
h&#333;t&#333;&#x303;</i> (active construction), I had risen. The usual forms of the
present and past of the verb substantive are:&mdash;</p>

<p>The past changes for gender, but the present is immutable
in this respect. <i>Ah&#7877;</i> is usually considered to be a descendant of
the Sanskrit <i>asmi</i>, I am,<a name="fa8b" id="fa8b" href="#ft8b"><span class="sp">8</span></a> while <i>h&#333;t&#333;&#x303;</i> is derived from the Pr. <i>ho&#7745;ta&#333;</i>,
the present participle of what corresponds to the Skr. root <i>bh&#363;</i>,
become.</p>

<p>A potential passive and a causal are formed by adding <i>av</i> to the
root of a simple verb. The former follows the first, or intransitive,
and the latter the second or transitive conjugation. The potential
passive of a neuter verb is necessarily construed impersonally. The
causal verb denotes indirect agency; thus, <i>kar<span class="sp">a</span>n&#7877;</i>, to do, <i>karav<span class="sp">a</span>n&#7877;</i>,
to cause a person to do; <i>ty&#257;cy&#257;-ka&#7693;&#363;n my&#257; t&#7877; karavil&#7877;</i>, I caused him
to do that, literally, by-means-of-him by-me that was-caused-to-be-done.
The potential, being passive, has the subject in the dative
(cf. Latin <i>mihi est ludendum</i>) or in the instrumental of the genitive,
as in <i>mal&#257;</i> (dative), or <i>m&#257;jhy&#257;n&#7877;</i> (instr. of <i>m&#257;dzh&#257;</i>, of me), <i>uth<span class="sp">a</span>vat&#275;&#x303;</i>, I
can rise, literally, for-me, or by-my-(action), rising-can-be-done. So,
<i>R&#257;m&#257;l&#257;</i>, or <i>R&#257;m&#257;cy&#257;n&#7877;</i>, <i>p&#333;th&#299; v&#257;c<span class="sp">a</span>val&#299;</i>, R&#257;m could read a book (by
R. a book could be read).</p>

<p>Several verbs are irregular. These must be learnt from the
grammars. Here we may mention <i>h&#333;&#7751;&#7877;</i>, to become, past participle
<i>dzh&#257;l&#257;</i>; <i>y&#275;&#7751;&#7877;</i>, to come, past participle <i>&#257;l&#257;</i>; and <i>dz&#257;&#7751;&#7877;</i>, to go, past
participle <i>g&#275;l&#257;</i>. There are also numerous compound verbs. One
of these, making a passive, is formed by conjugating the verb <i>dz&#257;&#7751;&#7877;</i>,
to go, with the past participle of the principal verb. Thus, <i>m&#257;ril&#257;
dz&#257;t&#333;</i>, he is being killed, literally, he goes killed.</p>

<p><i>Literature.</i>&mdash;As elsewhere in India, the modern vernacular literature
of the Maratha country arose under the influence of the religious
reformation inaugurated by R&#257;m&#257;nuja early in the 12th century.
He and his followers taught devotion to a personal deity instead of
the pantheism hitherto prevalent. The earliest writer of whom we
have any record is N&#257;md&#275;v (13th century), whose hymns in honour
of Vithoba, a personal form of Vishnu, have travelled far beyond
the home of their writer, and are even found in the Sikh <i>Àdi Granth</i>.
Dny&#257;n&#333;b&#257;, a younger contemporary, wrote a paraphrase of the
Sanskrit <i>Bhagavad G&#299;t&#257;</i>, which is still much admired. Passing over
several intermediate writers we come to the period of the warrior
Sivaji, the opponent of Aurangzeb. He was a disciple of R&#257;md&#257;s
(1608-1681), who exercised great influence over him, and whose
<i>D&#257;sb&#333;dh</i>, a work on religious duty, is a classic. Contemporary with
R&#257;md&#257;s and Sivaji was Tuk&#257;r&#257;m (1608-1649), a &#346;&#363;dra by caste,
and yet the greatest writer in the language. He began life as a petty
shopkeeper, and being unsuccessful both in his business and in his
family relations, he abandoned the world and became a wandering
ascetic. His <i>Abhangs</i> or &ldquo;unbroken&rdquo; hymns, probably so called
from their indefinite length and loose, flowing metre, are famous in
the country of his birth. They are fervent, but though abounding
in excellent morality, do not rise to any great height as poetry.
Other Marathi poets who may be mentioned are &#346;r&#299;dhar (1678-1728),
the most copious of all, who translated the <i>Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;na</i>, and
the learned May&#363;ra or M&#333;r&#333;pant (1729-1794), whose works smell
too much of the lamp to satisfy European standards of criticism.
Mah&#299;pati (1715-1790) was an imitator of Tuk&#257;r&#257;m, but his chief
importance rests on the fact that he collected the popular traditions
about national saints, and was thus the author of the <i>Acta sanctorum</i>
of the Marathas. L&#257;va&#7751;&#299;s, or erotic lyrics, by various writers, are
popular, but are often more passionate than decent. Another
branch of Marathi literature is composed of <i>P&#257;w&#257;&#7693;&#257;s</i> or war-ballads,
mostly by nameless poets, which are sung everywhere throughout
the country. There is a small prose literature, consisting of narratives
of historical events (the so-called <i>Bakhars</i>), moral maxims
and popular tales.</p>

<p>In the 19th century the facilities of the printing press are responsible
for a great mass of published matter. Most of the best works
have been written in English by learned natives, upon whom the
methods of European scholarship have exercised more influence than
elsewhere in India, and have given rise to a happy combination
of western science with Oriental lore. No vernacular authors of
outstanding merit have appeared during the last century.</p>

<p>Konkani once had a literature of its own, which is said to have been
destroyed by the Inquisition at Goa. Temples and manuscripts
were burnt wholesale. Under Roman Catholic auspices a new
literature arose, the earliest writer being an Englishman, Thomas
Stephens (Thomaz Estevão), who came to Goa in 1579, wrote the
first Konkani grammar, and died there in 1619. Amongst other
works, he was the author of a Konkani paraphrase of the New
Testament in metrical form, which has been several times reprinted
and is still a favourite work with the native Christians. Since his
time there has grown up a considerable body of Christian literature
from the pens of Portuguese missionaries and native converts.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Authorities.</span>&mdash;Marathi is fortunate in possessing the best
dictionary of any modern Indian language, J. T. Molesworth&rsquo;s
(2nd ed., Bombay, 1857). Navalkar&rsquo;s (3rd ed., Bombay, 1894) is
the best grammar. The earliest students of Marathi were the
Portuguese, who were familiar only with the language as spoken
on the coast, <i>i.e.</i> with the standard dialect of the northern Konkan
and with Konkani. They have since devoted themselves to these
two forms of speech. For the former, reference may be made to
the <i>Grammatica da lingua Concani no dialecto do norte</i>, by J. F. da
Cunha Rivara (Goa, 1858). For Konkani proper, see A. F. X.
Maffei&rsquo;s <i>Grammar</i> (Mangalore, 1882) and <i>Dictionaries</i> (ibid., 1883).
These are in English. Monsenhor S. R. Dalgado is the author of
a <i>Konkan-Portuguese Dictionary</i> (Bombay, 1893).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARATHON,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span>, a plain on the N.E. coast of Attica, divided
from the plain of Athens by the range of Pentelicus; it contained
four villages&mdash;Marathon, Probalinthos, Tricorythos and Oenoe&mdash;which
originally formed an independent <i>tetrapolis</i> and in historical
times still upheld peculiar rites and legendary associations,
chiefly connected with Heracles and Theseus. In the 6th century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> it served as a base for Peisistratus (<i>q.v.</i>), who owned much
property in that district, for securing the rest of Attica. The
plain derives its fame mainly from the battle in which the
Athenians and Plataeans defeated the Persians (490 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). The
Persian force had been sent by King Darius to punish the
Athenians for previous interferences in Asia and to restore their
tyrant Hippias. It was probably by advice of the latter that
the generals Datis and Artaphernes landed their troops, numbering
perhaps 50,000, at Marathon. The Athenians, on the
recommendation of their strategus Miltiades, resolved to meet
this force in the open field, and sent out their full levy of 9000
heavy infantry under the polemarch Callimachus. They were
joined on the way by 1000 Plataeans, but were disappointed
of the assistance which they expected from Sparta. From their
station at the head of the Vrana valley, which slopes down to
Marathon plain, the Athenians for some days observed the
Persian army, which gave no sign of proceeding to attack. After
some waiting, Miltiades, who seems throughout to have played
a more prominent part than his superior Callimachus, drew up
the Athenian army for battle and charged down upon the enemy,
whose line was formed on the level about a mile distant. The
Athenian wings, whose formation had been made specially deep,
broke the opposing divisions by their impact; the centre was at
first overborne by the superior weight of the native Persians, but
ultimately was relieved by the victorious wings, which closed
in upon the Persian centre. The Persians were thereupon driven
back into the sea all along the line, and, although the majority
regained their ships, no less than 6400 were left dead, as against
192 Athenians. The Persian fleet, of which perhaps a detachment
had been sent on before the battle, now sailed round Cape
Sunium in order to effect a landing at Phalerum, close by Athens,
and with the help of traitors within the walls to take the city by
surprise. But Miltiades, who had suspected some plot all along,
and had lately been warned by a signal on Mt Pentelicus which
he interpreted as a message to the Persians, marched back the
victorious army in time to defend Athens. The enemy, upon
noticing his presence, did not venture a second disembarcation
and retired straightway out of Greek waters. The details of
the battle, and the Persian plan of campaign, are not made clear
by our ancient sources, but reconstructions have been attempted
by numerous modern authorities.</p>

<p>The tumulus or &ldquo;Soros&rdquo; was excavated by M. Stais in 1891
and 1892. A slight previous excavation had brought to light
some prehistoric implements, and it was supposed that the
mound had no connexion with the battle; but it has now been
discovered that the presence of those prehistoric objects was
accidental. Underlying the mound was found a stratum about
85 ft. long by 20 broad, consisting of a layer of sand, above which
lay the ashes and bones of many corpses; together with these
were the remains of many lecythi and other vases, some of them
contemporary with the Persian wars, some of them of much
earlier style, and probably taken in the emergency from neighbouring
cemeteries. It is conjectured with some probability
that a large vase containing ashes may have been used as the
burial urn of one of the Athenian generals who fell. There was
also, in the middle of the stratum, a trench for funeral offerings
about 30 ft. by 3; it contained bones of beasts, with ashes and
fragments of vases. There can therefore be no doubt that the
tumulus was piled up to commemorate the Athenians who fell
in the battle, and that it marks the place where the carnage was
thickest. A selection from the contents of the tumulus has been
placed in the National Museum at Athens.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARAZION,<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> a small seaport in the St Ives parliamentary
division of Cornwall, England, on the shore of Mount&rsquo;s Bay,
2 m. E. of Penzance, served by the Great Western railway. Pop.
(1901), 1251. A causeway of boulders and pebbles, thrown up
by the sea and passable at low tide, unites Marazion with the
insular St Michael&rsquo;s Mount (<i>q.v.</i>). The church of St Hilary,
destroyed by fire in 1853, had a very fine spire, which has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page676" id="page676"></a>676</span>
faithfully reproduced in the restored building. Unusual archaeological
interest attaches to the churchyard. Its inscribed stones
date from the 4th century, one being in honour of Constantine
the Great. Another has Cornish lettering, which can no longer
be deciphered; and there are British and Roman crosses. Market
gardening and fishing are the main industries.</p>

<p>The charter attributed to Robert count of Mortain, granting
lands and liberties to St Michael&rsquo;s Mount, opposite Marazion,
included a market on Thursdays. This appears to have been
held from the first on the mainland. From it is probably derived
the Marghasbigan (<i>Parvum Forum</i>) of the earlier and the
Marghasyewe or Marketjew (<i>Forum Jovis</i>) of the later charters.
It may be added that a Jewish origin has been ascribed to the
place from the name Marketjew. It is certain that Richard king
of the Romans provided that the three fairs, on the two feasts
of St Michael and at Mid-Lent, and the three markets which had
hitherto been held by the priors of St Michael&rsquo;s Mount on land
not their own at Marghasbighan, should in future be held on
their own land at Marchadyou. He transferred in fact the fairs
and markets from the demesne lands of the Bloyous in Marazion
to those of the prior. To remedy the loss incurred by this
measure Ralph Bloyou in 1331 procured for himself and his heirs
a market on Mondays and a fair on the vigil, feast and morrow
of St Andrew at Marghasyon. In Leland&rsquo;s time the market
was held at Marhasdeythyow (<i>Forum Jovis</i>), and both Norden
(1582) and Carew (1602) tell us that Marcajewe signifies the
Thursday&rsquo;s market, which, whether etymologically sound or
not, shows that the prior&rsquo;s market had prevailed over its rival.
In 1595 Queen Elizabeth granted to Marazion a charter of incorporation.
This ratified the grant of St Andrew&rsquo;s fair, provided
for another on the Feast of St Barnabas and established
a market on Saturdays. The corporation was to consist of a
mayor, 8 aldermen and 12 capital burgesses. This corporation
continued to administer the affairs of the borough until
it was dissolved under the Municipal Corporations Act in 1835,
when the property belonging to it was vested in charity commissioners.
The chairman of the commissioners retains possession
of the regalia. Of the fairs only the Michaelmas fair
has survived and all the markets have gone. It is frequently
stated that Marazion had formerly the right of returning two
members to parliament, but that owing to its inability to pay
the members&rsquo; expenses the right was lost. Under the Commonwealth
an attempt was made to secure or recover the right, and
two members are said to have been returned, but they were not
allowed to take their seats. Remains of an ancient bronze
furnace, discovered near the town, tend to prove that tin-smelting
was practised here at an early period. Marazion was
once a flourishing town, and owed its prosperity to the throng
of pilgrims who came to visit St Michael&rsquo;s Mount. During the
first half of the 16th century it was twice plundered; first by the
French, and later by the Cornish rebels. The rise and progress
of the neighbouring borough of Penzance in the 17th century
was the undoing of Marazion.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MARBLE<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>marmar</i>, Gr. <span class="grk" title="marmaros">&#956;&#940;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, shining stone),
a term applied to any limestone or dolomite which is sufficiently
close in texture to admit of being polished. Many other ornamental
stones&mdash;such as serpentine, alabaster and even granite&mdash;are
sometimes loosely designated marble, but by accurate writers
the term is invariably restricted to those crystalline and compact
varieties of carbonate of lime (occasionally with carbonate of
magnesia) which, when polished, are applicable to purposes of
decoration. The crystalline structure is typically shown in
statuary marble. A fractured surface of this stone displays a
multitude of sparkling facets, which are the rhombohedral
cleavage-planes of the component grains. The beautiful lustre
of polished statuary marble is due to the light penetrating for a
short distance into the rock and then suffering reflection at the
surfaces of the deeper-lying crystals. The durability of marble
in a dry atmosphere or when protected from rain renders it a
valuable building stone (<i>q.v.</i>); on the other hand, when exposed
to the weather or the acid atmosphere of large cities, its surface
readily crumbles.</p>

<p><i>Statuary and Economic Marbles.</i>&mdash;Among statuary marbles the
first place may be assigned to the famous Pentelic marble, the
material in which Pheidias, Praxiteles, and other Greek sculptors
executed their principal works. The characteristics of this
stone are well seen in the Elgin marbles, which were removed
from the Parthenon at Athens, and are now at the British
Museum. The marble was derived from the quarries of Mount
Pentelicus in Attica. Several large buildings have recently
been constructed with this marble in London. The neighbouring
mountain of Hymettus likewise yielded marbles, but these
were neither so pure in colour nor so fine in texture as those of
Pentelicus. Parian marble, another stone much used by Greek
sculptors and architects, was quarried in the isle of Paros,
chiefly at Mount Marpessa. It is called by ancient writers
<i>lychnites</i> (from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="lychnos">&#955;&#973;&#967;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, a lamp) in allusion to the fact
that the quarries were worked by the light of lamps. The Venus
de&rsquo; Medici is a notable example of work in this material. Carrara
marble is better known than any of the Greek marbles, inasmuch
as it constitutes the stone invariably employed by the best
sculptors of the present day. This marble occurs abundantly
in the Apuan Alps, an offshoot of the Apennines, and is largely
worked in the neighbourhood of Carrara, Massa and Serravezza.
Stone from this district was employed in Rome for architectural
purposes in the time of Augustus, but the finer varieties, adapted
to the needs of the sculptor, were not discovered until some
time later. It is in Carrara marble that the finest works of
Michelangelo and of Canova are executed. The purest varieties
of this stone are of snow-white colour and of fine saccharoidal
texture. Silica is disseminated through some of the marble,
becoming a source of annoyance to the workman; while occasionally
it separates as beautifully pellucid crystals of quartz
known as &ldquo;Carrara diamonds.&rdquo; The geological age of the
marbles of the Apuan Alps has been a subject of much dispute,
some geologists regarding them as metamorphosed Triassic,
Liassic or Rhaetic rocks. Much of the common marble is of a
bluish colour, and therefore unfit for statuary purposes; when
streaked with blue and grey veins the stone is known as <i>bardiglio</i>.
Curiously enough, the common white marble of Tuscany comes
to England as Sicilian marble&mdash;a name probably due to its
having been formerly re-shipped from some port in Sicily.</p>

<p>Although crystalline marbles fit for statuary work are not
found to any extent in Great Britain, the limestones of the
Palaeozoic formations yield a great variety of marbles well
suited for architectural purposes. The Devonian rocks of south
Devon are rich in handsome marbles, presenting great diversity
of tint and pattern. Plymouth, Torquay, Ipplepen, Babbacombe
and Chudleigh may be named as the principal localities.
Many of these limestones owe their beauty to the fossil corals which
they contain, and are hence known as &ldquo;madrepore marbles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of far greater importance than the marbles of the Devonian
system are those of Carboniferous age. It is from the Carboniferous
or Mountain Limestone that British marbles are mainly
derived. Marbles of this age are worked in Derbyshire and
Yorkshire, in the neighbourhood of Bristol, in North Wales,
in the Isle of Man, and in various parts of Ireland. One of
the most beautiful of these stones is the &ldquo;encrinital marble,&rdquo; a
material which owes its peculiarities to the presence of numerous
encrinites, or stone-lilies. These fossils, when cut in various
directions, give a characteristic pattern to the stone. The
joints of the stems and arms are known from their shape as
&ldquo;wheel-stones,&rdquo; and the rock itself has been called &ldquo;entrochal
marble.&rdquo; The most beautiful varieties are those in which the
calcareous fossils appear as white markings on a ground of grey
limestone. In Belgium a black marble with small sections of
crinoid stems is known as <i>petit granit</i>, while in Derbyshire a
similar rock, crowded with fragments of minute encrinites, is
termed &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s-eye marble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps the most generally useful marbles yielded by the
Carboniferous system are the black varieties, which are largely
employed for chimney-pieces, vases, and other ornamental
objects. The colour of most black limestone is due to the
presence of bituminous matter. Such limestone commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page677" id="page677"></a>677</span>
emits a fetid odour when struck; and the colour, being of organic
origin, is discharged on calcination. Black marbles, more or
less dense in colour, are quarried in various parts of Ireland,
especially at Kilkenny and near Galway, but the finest kind is
obtained from near Ashford in Derbyshire. From Ashford is also
derived a very beautiful stone known as &ldquo;rosewood marble.&rdquo;
This is a dense brown laminated limestone, displaying when
polished a handsome pattern somewhat resembling the grain
of rosewood; it occurs in very limited quantity, and is used
chiefly for inlaid work. The black marble of Frosterley, Yorkshire,
is another Carboniferous example which owes its &ldquo;figure&rdquo;
or pattern to the presence of large corals.</p>

<p>With the rosewood marble may be compared the well-known
&ldquo;landscape marble&rdquo; or Cotham stone, an argillaceous limestone
with peculiar dendritic markings, due probably to the infiltration
of water containing oxide of manganese. This limestone occurs
in irregular masses near the base of the White Lias, or uppermost
division of the Rhaetic series. It is found principally in
the neighbourhood of Bristol. The arborescent forms depicted
in bluish-grey upon this landscape marble form a marked contrast
to the angular markings of warm brown colour which are
seen on slabs of &ldquo;ruin marble&rdquo; from Florence&mdash;a stone occasionally
known also as landscape stone, or <i>pietra paesina</i>.</p>

<p>British limestones of Secondary and Tertiary age are not
generally compact enough to be used as marbles, but some of
the shelly beds are employed to a limited extent for decorative
purposes. &ldquo;Ammonite marble&rdquo; is a dark brown limestone
from the Lower Lias of Somersetshire, crowded with ammonites,
principally <i>A. planicostata</i>. Under the name of Forest marble,
geologists recognize a local division of the Lower Oolitic series,
so named by W. Smith from Wychwood Forest in Oxfordshire,
where shelly limestones occur; and these, though of little
economic value, are capable of being used as rough marbles.
But the most important marbles of the Secondary series are
the shelly limestones of the Purbeck formation. Purbeck
marble was a favourite material with medieval architects, who
used it freely for slender clustered columns and for sepulchral
monuments. It consists of a mass of the shells of a fresh-water
snail, <i>Paludina carinifera</i>, embedded in a blue, grey or greenish
limestone, and is found in the Upper Purbeck beds of Swanage
in Dorsetshire. Excellent examples of its use may be seen in
Westminster Abbey and in the Temple Church, as well as in
the cathedrals of Salisbury, Winchester, Worcester and Lincoln.
Sussex marble is a very similar stone, occurring in thin beds in
the Weald clay, and consisting largely of the shells of <i>Paludina</i>,
principally <i>P. sussexiensis</i> and <i>P. fluviorum</i>. The altar stones and
the episcopal chair in Canterbury Cathedral are of this material.</p>

<p>Certain calcareous metamorphic rocks frequently form stones
which are sufficiently beautiful to be used for ornamental
purposes, and are generally classed as marbles. Such serpentinous
limestones are included by petrologists under the
term &ldquo;ophicalcite.&rdquo; The famous <i>verde antico</i> is a rock of this
character. Mona marble is an ophicalcite from the metamorphic
series of the Isle of Anglesey, while the &ldquo;Irish green&rdquo; of architects
is a similar rock from Connemara in western Galway. It
is notable that some of the &ldquo;white marble&rdquo; of Connemara has
been found by W. King and T. H. Rowney to consist almost
wholly of malacolite, a silicate of calcium and magnesium.</p>

<p>A beautiful marble has been worked to a limited extent in
the island of Tiree, one of the Hebrides, but the quarry appears
to be now exhausted. This Tiree marble is a limestone having
a delicate carnelian colour diffused through it in irregular
patches, and containing rounded crystals of sahlite, a green
augitic mineral resembling malacolite in composition.</p>

<p>Many marbles which are prized for the variegated patterns
they display owe these patterns to their formation in concentric
zones&mdash;such marbles being in fact stalagmitic deposits of
carbonate of lime, sometimes consisting of aragonite. One
of the most beautiful stalagmitic rocks is the so-called onyx
marble of Algeria. This stone was largely used in the buildings
of Carthage and Rome, but the quarries which yielded it were
not known to modern sculptors until 1849, when it was rediscovered
near Oued-Abdallah. The stone is a beautifully translucent
material, delicately clouded with yellow and brown, and
is greatly prized by French workmen. Large deposits of a very
fine onyx-like marble, similar to the Algerian stone, have been
worked at Técali, about 35 miles from the city of Mexico. Among
other stalagmitic marbles, mention may be made of the well-known
Gibraltar stone, which is often worked into models of
cannon and other ornamental objects. This stalagmite is much
deeper in colour and less translucent than the onyx marbles
of Algeria and Mexico. A richly tinted stalagmitic stone worked
in California is known as Californian marble. It is worth noting
that the &ldquo;alabaster&rdquo; of the ancients was stalagmitic carbonate
of lime, and that this stone is therefore called by mineralogists
&ldquo;Oriental alabaster&rdquo; in order to distinguish it from our modern
&ldquo;alabaster,&rdquo; which is a sulphate, and not a carbonate, of lime.
Gypsum capable of taking a polish is found at Fauld in Staffordshire
and in Italy and Spain.</p>

<p>The brown and yellow colours which stalagmitic marbles
usually present are due to the presence of oxide of iron. This
colouring matter gives special characters to certain stones, such
as the <i>giallo antico</i>, or antique yellow marble of the Italian
antiquaries. Siena marble is a reddish mottled stone obtained
from the neighbourhood of Siena in Tuscany; and a somewhat
similar stone is found in King&rsquo;s County, Ireland. True red
marble is by no means common, but it does occur, of bright
and uniform colour, though in very small quantity, in the
Carboniferous limestone of Derbyshire and north-east Staffordshire.
The red marble called <i>rosso antico</i> is often confounded
with the <i>porfiro rosso antico</i>, which is really a mica-hornblende
porphyrite owing its red colour to the mineral withamite.</p>

<p>Fire marble is the name given to a brown shelly limestone
containing ammonites and other fossil shells, which present a
brilliant display of iridescent colours, like those of precious
opal. It occurs in rocks of Liassic age at the lead-mines of
Bleiberg in Carinthia, and is worked into snuff-boxes and other
small objects. By mineralogists it is often termed <i>lumachella</i>,
an Italian name which may, however, be appropriately applied
to any marble which contains small shells.</p>

<p>The quarries of France, Belgium, Italy and Spain, not to
mention less important localities, yield a great diversity of
marbles, and almost each stone bears a distinctive name, often
of trivial meaning; but in this article it is impossible to enumerate
the local names used by marble-workers in different countries
to distinguish the various stones which pass under their hands.</p>

<p>America possesses some valuable deposits of marble, which
in the eastern States have been extensively worked. The
crystalline limestones of western New England furnish an abundance
of white and grey marble, while a beautiful material fit
for statuary work has been quarried near Rutland in Vermont.
A grey bird&rsquo;s-eye marble is obtained from central New York,
and the greyish clouded limestones of Thomaston in Maine have
been extensively quarried. Of the variegated and coloured
marbles, perhaps the most beautiful are those from the northern
part of Vermont, in the neighbourhood of Lake Champlain.
A fine brecciated marble is found on the Maryland side of the
Potomac, below Point of Rocks. Among the principal localities
for black marble may be mentioned Shoreham in Vermont
and Glen Falls in New York. In 1908 the American States
producing marble were, in order of value, Vermont, Georgia,
Tennessee, New York, Massachusetts, Alabama, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, California, Colorado, Alaska, N. Carolina, Kentucky,
New Mexico, Utah, Missouri and Idaho. In Canada the
crystalline limestones of the pre-Cambrian series yield beautiful
marbles.</p>

<p>In India we find important quarries at Makrana in Rajputana,&mdash;a
locality which is said to have yielded the marble for the
famous Taj Mahal at Agra. In the valley of the Nerbudda, near
Jabalpur, there is a large development of marble. The white
marble which is used for the delicately pierced screens called
<i>jalee</i> work is obtained from near Raialo, in Ulwar.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Petrography.</i>&mdash;Marbles are uniformly crystalline, and hence have
no bedding or schistosity which would tend to make them fissile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page678" id="page678"></a>678</span>
but are entirely massive and free from grain. The microstructure
of pure marble is comparatively simple. In thin sections they
are seen to be built up of somewhat rounded grains of calcite, fitting
closely together in a mosaic; very rarely do any grains show traces
of crystalline form. They are colourless and transparent, and
are usually traversed by a lattice-work of sharply defined cleavage
cracks, which correspond to the rhombohedral faces. In polarized
light the colours are pinkish or greenish white, or in very thin sections
iridescent because the mineral has a very strong double refraction.
They may also be crossed by bars or stripes, each of which indicates
a twin plate, for the crystals are usually polysynthetic. This twinning
may be produced by pressure acting either during the crystallization
of the rock or at a later period.</p>

<p>The purest marbles generally contain some accessory minerals,
and in many of these rocks they form a considerable proportion of
the whole mass. The commonest are quartz in small rounded
grains, scales of colourless or pale yellow mica (muscovite and
phlogopite), dark shining flakes of graphite and small crystals of
pyrites or iron oxides. Even fine Carrara marble leaves a residue
of this sort when dissolved in acid. Many marbles contain other
minerals which are usually silicates of lime or magnesia. The list
of these accessories is a very large one. Augite is very frequent and
may be white (malacolite) or pale green (coccolite, sahlite, diopside);
hornblende occurs as white bladed tremolite or pale green actinolite;
feldspars may be present also, such as orthoclase, or more frequently
some plagioclase such as albite, labradorite and anorthite; scapolite
(or wernerite); various kinds of garnet; vesuvianite, spinel, forsterite,
periclase, brucite, talc, zoisite and epidote, chondrodite, biotite,
datolite, sphene and apatite may be mentioned as typical accessory
minerals. The presence of metalliferous minerals such as galena,
grey or red silver ores, zinc blende, antimonite, chalcopyrite,
molybdenite, cassiterite, usually indicates impregnation by
ore-bearing
solutions, especially if these substances occur in workable
quantities. The rubies of Burma are found in crystalline limestones
and are constantly accompanied by precious spinel (or balas-ruby).</p>

<p>These minerals represent impurities in the original limestone which
crystallized at the time that the marble became crystalline. The
silicates derive their silica mainly from sand or infiltrated siliceous
deposits; the alumina represents an admixture of clay; the iron came
from limonite or hematite in the original state of the rock. Where
the silicates bulk largely because the original limestone was highly
impure, all the carbonic acid may be driven out and replaced by
silica during the process of recrystallization. The rock is then a
calc-silicate rock, hard, tough, flinty and no longer readily soluble
in acids. They are sometimes fine-grained hornstones (known as
calc-silicate hornfelses). Where white minerals predominate (wollastonite,
tremolite, feldspar) these rocks may have a close resemblance
to marbles, but often they are green from the abundance of green
augites and amphiboles, or brown (when garnet and vesuvianite
are present in quantity) or yellow (with epidote, chondrodite or
sphene). Decomposition induces further changes in colour owing to
the formation of green or yellow serpentine, pale green talc, red hematite,
and brown limonite. Most of the coloured or variegated crystalline
marbles have originated in this manner. Often bands of calc-silicate
rock alternate with bands of marble, and they may be folded
or bent; in other cases, nodules and patches of silicates occur in a
matrix of pure marble. Earth movements may shatter the rocks,
producing fissures afterwards filled with veins of calcite; in this way
the beautiful brecciated or veined marbles are produced. Sometimes
the broken fragments are rolled and rounded by the flow of the
marble under pressure and pseudo-conglomerates or &ldquo;crush conglomerates&rdquo;
result. In other cases the banding of the marble
indicates the original bedding of the calcareous sediments. Crystalline
limestones which contain much mica may be called cipollins;
in them quartz, garnet and hornblende often also occur. The
ophicalcites are marbles containing much serpentine, which has been
formed by the decomposition of forsterite, olivine or augite. The
much-discussed <i>Eozoon</i>, at one time supposed to be the earliest known
fossil and found in Archaean limestones in Canada, is now known
to be inorganic and to belong to the ophicalcites.</p>

<p>Many marbles, probably all of them, are metamorphosed limestones.
The passage of limestones rich in fossils into true marbles
as they approach great crystalline intrusions of granite is a phenomenon
seen in many parts of the world; occasionally the recrystallization
of the rock has not completely obliterated the organic
structures (<i>e.g.</i> at Carrara and at Bergen in Norway). The agencies
which have induced the metamorphism are heat and pressure, the
heat arising from the granite and the pressure from overlying masses
of rock, for these changes took place before the granite cooled and
while it was still deeply buried beneath the surface. In 1806
Sir James Hall described a series of experiments proving this.
He enclosed chalk in a gun-barrel securely plugged and heated it
to a high temperature in a furnace. Carbonic acid was given off
by the chalk and produced a great pressure in the interior of the
tube. After slow cooling the mass was found to have become
converted into granular crystalline marble. As rocks which have
undergone changes of this kind are commonest in the oldest and
deepest layers of the earth&rsquo;s crust, most marbles are Palaeozoic or
pre-Cambrian. They occur very often with mica schists, phyllites,
&amp;c., which were beds of clay alternating with the original
limestone. Formerly it was supposed that some of these marbles
were crystalline sediments or even igneous rocks, but the tendency
of modern geology is to assume that they were ordinary limestones,
many of which may have been fossiliferous. In regions where the
sedimentary rocks have been converted into schists, gneisses and
granulites, the limestones are represented by calc schists, cipollins
and marbles. Often no granite or other intrusive rock is present
which may be regarded as the cause of the metamorphism. The
marbles are often banded or schistose, and under the microscope
show crushing and deformation of the component crystals, such
as would have been produced by the earth pressures which accompany
rock-folding. These crush structures have been obtained
experimentally in marbles subjected to great pressures in steel
cylinders. In the recrystallization of these limestones the direct
heating action of igneous intrusions may have played no part, but
the rise of temperature and increase of pressure due to the folding
of great rock masses have probably been the operating causes.
This type of metamorphism has been distinguished by the name
<i>marmarosis</i> (Sir A. Geikie, <i>Text Book of Geology</i>, 1882).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARBLEHEAD,<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> a township of Essex county, Massachusetts,
U.S.A., occupying a rocky promontory on Massachusetts Bay,
about 16 m. N. of Boston. Pop. (1890), 8202; (1900), 7582;
(1905), 7209; (1910), 7338. Area, about 4 sq. m. Marblehead
is served by the Boston &amp; Maine railroad, and by electric
railways connecting with Salem, Lynn and Boston. It is a
quaint old town, with a number of houses dating back to the
17th and 18th centuries. Among the older buildings are the Lee
mansion (1768), St Michael&rsquo;s church (P. E., 1714), and the old
town-hall (1727), sometimes called Marblehead&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cradle of
Liberty.&rdquo; Abbot Hall (1877), the municipal building, also
contains the public library and several noteworthy paintings,
including &ldquo;The Spirit of &rsquo;76&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yankee Doodle&rdquo; by
Archibald M. Willard. The post office and custom-house was
completed in 1904. There are several parks (Crocker, Fort
Sewall, Seaside, and Fountain), and an old burying-ground, in
which many of the early settlers and a number of soldiers of
the War of Independence (including General John Glover) are
buried; and a granite monument near the railway station
commemorates the taking of the British supply and powder
ship &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; off Marblehead in 1776 by Captain James Mugford,
who was killed during the fight. The commodious harbour,
nearly landlocked, is formed by a rocky peninsula known as
Marblehead Neck. On this are the club-houses of the Eastern
and Corinthian Yacht clubs; and Marblehead is a popular
yachting centre. The manufacture of children&rsquo;s shoes is the
principal industry. Shipbuilding, once important, has been
superseded by yacht and launch construction.</p>

<p>Marblehead, originally a part of Salem, known as Marble
Harbor, was settled about 1629 by English emigrants (probably
mostly from Lincolnshire and Devonshire); later (after about
1700) many emigrants from the Channel Islands settled here,
and to them the dialectical peculiarities of Marblehead have
often (perhaps mistakenly) been attributed. Marblehead was
separately incorporated as a town in 1649. In the colonial
period Marblehead was an important commercial port, and at
one time was one of the most populous places in Massachusetts.
After the passage of the Boston Port Bill (1774) it was made
the port of entry instead of Boston, but its merchants refused
to take advantage of this opportunity and patriotically invited
the Boston merchants to use their wharves and warehouses.
During the War of Independence many &ldquo;state cruisers&rdquo;
(chartered at the Continental expense) set out from this port,
the most famous being the &ldquo;Lee,&rdquo; commanded by John Manley<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
(1733-93); in November 1775 this cruiser captured the &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo;
with military stores valued at £20,541, which were taken to the
American army at Cambridge. The &ldquo;Lee&rdquo; was manned by
fifty men of the &ldquo;amphibious regiment,&rdquo; which under General
John Glover (1732-1797) rendered invaluable services to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page679" id="page679"></a>679</span>
Washington in conveying his troops across the East River after
the battle of Long Island, and later in ferrying them across the
Delaware before the battle of Trenton. Marblehead furnished
more than 1000 men to the Continental army. During the
war of 1812 the sea fight between the &ldquo;Chesapeake&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; took place (June 1, 1813) off the adjacent coast.
Marblehead was the scene of Benjamin (nicknamed &ldquo;Flood&rdquo;)
Ireson&rsquo;s ride, immortalized by J. G. Whittier.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARBLES,<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> a children&rsquo;s game of great antiquity, wide distribution,
and uncertain origin, played with small spheres of
stone, glass, baked clay or other material, from one-third of an
inch to two inches in diameter. The game was once popular with
all classes. Tradition, both at Oxford and Cambridge, attests
that the game was formerly prohibited among undergraduates
on the steps of the Bodleian or the Senate House. There is
a similar tradition at Westminster School that the boys were
forbidden to play marbles in Westminster Hall on account of
the complaints made by members of parliament and lawyers.
An anonymous poem of the 17th century speaks of a boy about
to leave Eton as</p>

<p class="center f90">&ldquo;A dunce at syntax, but a dab at taw.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">Rogers, in <i>The Pleasures of Memory</i>, recalls how</p>

<p>&ldquo;On yon grey stone that fronts the chancel-door,</p>

</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Defoe (1720) writes of the seer Duncan Campbell: &ldquo;Marbles,
which he used to call children&rsquo;s playing at bowls, yielded him
mighty diversion; and he was so dexterous an artist at shooting
that little alabaster globe from between the end of his forefinger
and the knuckle of his thumb, that he seldom missed hitting plumb,
as the boys call it, the marble he aimed at, though at the distance
of two or three yards.&rdquo; The <i>locus classicus</i> on marbles in the
19th century is in the trial in <i>Pickwick</i>, where Serjeant Buzfuz
pathetically says of Master Bardell that &ldquo;his &lsquo;alley tors&rsquo; and
his &lsquo;commoneys&rsquo; are alike neglected; he forgets the long familiar
cry of &lsquo;knuckle down,&rsquo; and at tip-cheese, or odd and even, his
hand is out.&rdquo; Many similar passages might be adduced to
prove the former popularity of marbles with the young of all
classes. In some rural parts of Sussex Good Friday was known
as &ldquo;marble-day&rdquo; till late in the 19th century, since on that
day both old and young, including many who would never have
thought of playing marbles at other times, took part in the
game. There was some traditional reason for regarding marbles
as a Lenten sport&mdash;perhaps, as the Rev. W. D. Parish suggests,
&ldquo;to keep people from more boisterous and mischievous
enjoyments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The origin of the game is concealed in the mists of antiquity.
Marbles used by Egyptian and Roman children before the
Christian era are to be seen in the British Museum. Probably
some of the small stone spheres found among neolithic remains,
which Evans (<i>Ancient Stone Implements</i>, 2nd ed., p. 420) admits
to be too small for projectiles, are prehistoric marbles. It is
commonly assumed that the game which the youthful Augustus,
like other Roman children, played with nuts was a form of
marbles, and that the Latin phrase of <i>relinquere nuces</i>, in the
sense of putting away childish things, referred to this game.
Strutt believed that nuts of the roundest sort were the original
&ldquo;marbles.&rdquo; The earliest unmistakable reference to marbles
in literature seems to be in a French poem of the 12th century,
quoted by Littré <i>s.v.</i> <i>Bille</i>.</p>

<p>The marbles with which various games are nowadays played
are small spheres of stone, glass or baked clay. In the 18th
century they were mostly made from chips of marble (whence
the name) or other stone, which were ground into a roughly
spherical shape by attrition in a special iron mill. Nuremberg
was then the centre of the trade in marbles, though some were
made in Derbyshire, and indeed wherever there was a stonemason&rsquo;s
yard to afford raw material. The &ldquo;alley taw,&rdquo; as its
name indicates, was made of alabaster. In the first decade
of the 20th century English marbles were all imported from
central Germany, and the alleys, or most valuable marbles,
used for shooting, were mostly made of coloured glass, sold
retail from ten a penny to a penny each. Coloured stone marbles
and so-called china marbles&mdash;really of baked clay&mdash;were sold
at prices varying from forty to a hundred a penny, though even
the cheapest of these were painted by hand with concentric
rings. The well-made and highly valued alleys of earlier times
were no longer procurable, owing to the decline in popularity
of the sport. In the United States, however, much more
expensive and accurately rounded marbles were still manufactured,
the latest being of hollow steel.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There has never been any recognized authority on the game of
marbles, and it is probable that, in the past as in the present, every
parish and school and set of boys made its own rules. There are,
however, three or four distinct games which are traditional, and
may be found, with trifling variations, wherever the game is played.
Strutt, writing at the end of the 18th century, describes these as
follows: (1) &ldquo;Taw, wherein a number of boys put each of them
one or two marbles in a ring and shoot at them alternately with
other marbles, and he who obtains the most of them by beating
them out of the ring is the conqueror.&rdquo; The marbles placed in
the ring&mdash;whence the game is often known as &ldquo;ring-taw&rdquo;&mdash;are
usually of the cheaper kind known as &ldquo;commoneys,&rdquo; &ldquo;stoneys&rdquo;
or &ldquo;potteys,&rdquo; and the marble with which the player shoots is a
more valuable one, known as an &ldquo;alley,&rdquo; or &ldquo;alley taw,&rdquo; sometimes
spelt &ldquo;tor,&rdquo; as by Dickens. Usually it is necessary that the alley
should emerge from the ring as well as drive out another marble;
under other rules the ring is smaller, not more than a foot in diameter,
and the player must be skilful enough to leave his alley inside it,
whilst driving the object marble outside. (2) &ldquo;Nine holes: which
consists in bowling of marbles at a wooden bridge with nine arches.&rdquo;
Each arch bears a number, and the owner of the bridge pays that
number of marbles to the player who shoots through it, making
his profit from the missing marbles, which he confiscates; or the
game may simply be played so many up&mdash;usually 100. (3) &ldquo;There
is also another game of marbles where four, five or six holes, and
sometimes more, are made in the ground at a distance from each
other; and the business of every one of the players is to bowl a
marble by a regular succession into all the holes, which he who
completes in the fewest bowls obtains the victory.&rdquo; This primitive
form of golf is played by Zulu adults with great enthusiasm, and is
still popular among the car-drivers of Belfast. (4) &ldquo;Boss out,
or boss and span, also called hit and span, wherein one bowls a
marble to any distance that he pleases, which serves as a mark
for his antagonist to bowl at, whose business it is to hit the marble
first bowled, or lay his own near enough to it for him to span the
space between them and touch both marbles; in either case he wins,
if not, his marble remains where it lay and becomes a mark for the
first player, and so alternately until the game be won.&rdquo; In rural
parts of England this was known as a &ldquo;going-to-school game,&rdquo;
because it helped the players along the road.</p>

<p>Mr F. W. Hackwood states that, in the middle of the 19th century,
taverns in the Black Country had regular marble alleys, consisting
of a cement bed 20 ft. long by 12 ft. wide and 18 in. from the ground,
with a raised wooden rim to prevent the marbles from running off.
Players knelt down to shoot, and had to &ldquo;knuckle down&rdquo; fairly&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
to place the knuckle of the shooting hand on the ground, so
that the flip of the thumb was not aided by a jerk of the wrist.
The game was usually ring-taw. But marbles is now obsolete in
England as a game for adults (<i>Old English Sports</i>, London, 1907).</p>

<p>A writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (IX. ii. 314) thus describes the
marbles used by English boys in the middle of the 19th century:
&ldquo;In ring-taw the player put only commoneys in the ring, and
shot with the taws, which included stoneys, alleys and blood-alleys.
Commoneys were unglazed; potteys glazed in the kiln.
Stoneys were made from common pebbles such as were used for
road-mending; alleys and blood-alleys out of marble. The blood-alleys
were highly prized, and were called by this name because of
the spots or streaks of red in them. In Derbyshire, where large
numbers were made, they had relative values. The stoney was
worth three commoneys or two potteys. An alley was worth six
commoneys or four potteys. Blood-alleys were worth more, according
to the depth and arrangement of colour&mdash;from twelve to fifty
commoneys and stoneys in proportion.&rdquo; &ldquo;A taw with a history
was prized above rubies,&rdquo; another correspondent observes (IX. ii. 76).
&ldquo;All the best-made marbles were taws, and no commoneys or
potteys were used for shooting with, either in ring-taw or the various
hole-games.&rdquo; In Belfast, 1854-1858, the marble season extended
from Easter to June, when the ground was usually dry and hard.
The marbles were stoneys, of composition painted; crockeries, of
slightly glazed stone-ware, dark brown and yellow; clayeys, of
red brick clay baked in the fire; marbles, of white marble; china
alleys, with white glaze and painted rings; and glass marbles.
The two chief games were ring-taw and hole and taw; in the latter
three holes were made in a line, 6 ft. to 12 ft. apart, and the player
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page680" id="page680"></a>680</span>
had to go three times up and down according to somewhat elaborate
rules (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, IX. iii. 65). The stoneys and crockeries
were sold at twenty a penny; the clayeys were cheaper and were
not used as stakes; the marbles proper and china alleys, used as
taws for shooting, cost a halfpenny and a farthing respectively.
In other parts of the country the phraseology of marbles affords
some interesting problems for the philologist. We hear of &ldquo;alleys,
barios, poppos and stoneys&rdquo;; of &ldquo;marididdles,&rdquo; home-made
marbles of rolled and baked clay; in Scotland of &ldquo;bools, whinnies,
glassies, jauries&rdquo;; of &ldquo;Dutch alleys,&rdquo; and so forth. &ldquo;Dubs, trebs
and fobs,&rdquo; stand for twos, threes and fours. To be &ldquo;mucked&rdquo;
is to lose all one&rsquo;s &ldquo;mivvies&rdquo; or marbles. When the taw stayed
in the ring it was a &ldquo;chuck.&rdquo; &ldquo;Phobbo slips&rdquo; was a phrase used
to forbid the correction of an error.</p>

<p>The fullest account of the various games of marbles played by
English children is to be found in Mrs Gomme&rsquo;s <i>Traditional Games
of England, Scotland and Ireland</i> (London, 1898), under the headings
Boss-out, Bridgeboard, Bun-hole, Cob, Ho-go, Holy Bang, Hundreds,
Lag, Long-Tawl, Marbles, Nine-Holes, Ring-taw, Three-Holes.
Other games are known as Plum-pudding, or Picking the Plums,
in which one shoots at marbles in a row; Pyramids, in which the
marbles are arranged in a pyramid; Bounce About, Bounce Eye,
Conqueror, Die Shot, Fortifications, Handers, Increase Pound,
Knock Out, Rising Taw, Spanners, Tip-shears; Strutt&rsquo;s <i>Sports
and Pastimes</i>, ed. J. C. Cox (London, 1902). Much information
will also be found in <i>Notes and Queries, passim</i>&mdash;especially the 9th
series. For marbles in France see Larousse, <i>s.v.</i> <i>Billes</i>. See also

<p><span class="bold">MARBOT, JEAN BAPTISTE ANTOINE MARCELIN,<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron
de</span> (1782-1854), French soldier, son of General Jean Antoine de
Marbot (1754-1800), who died in the defence of Genoa under
Masséna, was born at La Rivière (Corrèze), on the 18th of
August 1782. He joined the republican army as a volunteer in
1799, rose rapidly to commissioned rank, and was aide-de-camp
to Marshal Augereau, commanding the VII. corps, in the war
against Prussia and Russia in 1806-7. After this he served
with great distinction in the Peninsular War under Lannes
and Masséna, and showed himself to be a dashing leader of
light cavalry in the Russian War of 1812 and the German campaign
of the following year. After a slow recovery from the
wounds he had received at Leipzig and Hanau, he was promoted
general of brigade by Napoleon during the Hundred Days, and
took part in, and was wounded at, the battle of Waterloo. He
was exiled at the second restoration and only returned to France
in 1819, after which, however, his intimacy with the duke of
Orleans secured him important military positions. After the
July restoration he was made <i>maréchal-de-camp</i>, and in this
rank he was present at the siege of Antwerp in 1832. He was
promoted lieutenant-general in 1836. From 1835 to 1840 he
served in various Algerian expeditions, and in 1845 he was
made a member of the Chamber of Peers. Three years later,
at the fall of Louis Philippe, he retired into private life. He
died at Paris on the 16th of November 1854. Marbot wrote
two pamphlets, <i>Remarques critiques sur l&rsquo;ouvrage de M. le
général Roguet, intitulé Considérations sur l&rsquo;art de la guerre</i> (1820),
and <i>La Nécessité d&rsquo;augmenter les forces militaires de la France</i>
(1825), but his fame rests chiefly, if not indeed wholly, on
the fascinating Memoirs of his <i>Life and Campaigns</i> which were
published in Paris in 1891 (Eng. trans., 1902). To ordinary
readers and to students of history alike these give a picture
of the Napoleonic age of warfare which for vividness and
romantic interest has never been surpassed.</p>

<p>His elder brother, <span class="sc">Antoine Adolphe Marcelin de Marbot</span>
(1781-1844), was born at La Rivière, on the 22nd of March 1781,
entered the army at an early age, obtained commissioned rank
in the revolutionary wars and became aide-de-camp to Bernadotte.
In 1802 he was arrested on the ground of being concerned
in a plot of the Republicans against the Consulate, but he was
released, though Napoleon continued to regard him as an
opponent of the established régime. After a term of duty with
the army in Santo Domingo he participated in the campaigns of
1806-7, and from 1808 to 1811 he was employed in the Peninsular
War. In the Russian War of 1812 he was wounded and
made prisoner. At the end of two years of captivity he returned
to France at the general peace, was aide-de-camp to Marshal
Davout during the Hundred Days, and thereafter passed into
retirement, from which he did not emerge till 1830. He attained
the rank of <i>maréchal-de-camp</i> under Louis Philippe, and died at
Bra, near Tulle, on the 2nd of June 1844.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARBURG,<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> a town of Austria, in Styria, 41 m. S. of Graz
by rail. Pop. (1900), 24,501. It is very picturesquely situated
on the left bank of the river Drave, on a plain called the Pettauer-Feld,
at the base of the well-wooded Bachergebirge. To the
north of the town the train passes through the Leitersberg
tunnel (725 yds. long), opened in 1846, while the Drave, which
has here a width of 200 yds., is spanned by a magnificent iron
bridge, built in 1845. The principal buildings are the cathedral,
dating from the 16th century, the tower of which, erected in
1623, is 136 ft. high, and the old castle. Its situation in the
midst of a fertile vine and fruit-growing district, connected by
the navigable Drave with Hungary, and by railway with Vienna,
Trieste, Tirol and Carinthia, makes it the centre of a considerable
traffic in wine and grain. Its industrial products are leather,
boots and shoes, iron and tin wares, liqueurs and sparkling wine,
and it also contains the extensive workshops of the South
Austrian railway. Marburg is the seat of the bishop of Lavant,
and is the native town of the famous Austrian admiral, Baron
Wilhelm of Tegetthoff (1827-1871). Near Marburg is the
village of Mariarast, the church of which is a popular place of
pilgrimage.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARBURG,<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> an ancient university town of Germany, in the
Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau, situated on the slope of a hill
on the right bank of the Lahn, 60 m. by rail N. of Frankfort-on-Main,
on the main line to Cassel. Pop. (1905), 20,137. On the
opposite bank of the river, here spanned by two bridges, lie
the suburb of Weidenhausen and the railway station of the
Prussian state railway. The hill on which the town lies is
crowned by the extensive old Schloss, a fine Gothic building,
the most noteworthy parts of which are the Rittersaal, dating
from 1277-1312, and the beautiful little chapel. This Schloss
was formerly the residence of the landgraves of Hesse, served
afterwards as a prison, and is now the repository of the historically
interesting and valuable archives of Hesse. The chief
architectural ornament of Marburg is, however, the Elisabethenkirche,
a veritable gem of the purest Early Gothic style, erected
by the grand master of the Teutonic Order in 1235-1283, to
contain the tomb of St Elizabeth of Hungary. The remains
of the saint were deposited in a rich silver-gilt sarcophagus,
which may still be seen, and were afterwards visited by myriads
of pilgrims, until the Protestant zeal of Landgrave Philip the
Generous caused him to remove the body to some unknown spot
in the church. The church also contains the tombs of numerous
Hessian landgraves and knights of the Teutonic Order. The
Lutheran church is another good Gothic edifice, dating mainly
from the 15th century. The town-hall, built in 1512, and
several fine houses in the Renaissance style, also deserve mention.
The university of Marburg, founded by Philip the Magnanimous
in 1527, was the first university established without papal
privileges, and speedily acquired a great reputation throughout
Protestant Europe. It has a library of 140,000 volumes, is
admirably equipped with medical and other institutes, which
form some of the finest modern buildings in the town, and was
attended, in 1905, by 1576 students. Marburg also possesses
a gymnasium, a &ldquo;Realschule,&rdquo; an agricultural school, a society
of naturalists, a hospital, and an extensive lunatic asylum. It
is the seat of a district court, and of superintendents of the
Lutheran and Reformed Churches. Marburg pottery is renowned;
and leather, iron wares and surgical instruments are
also manufactured there. The environs are very picturesque.</p>

<p>Marburg is first historically mentioned in a document of the
beginning of the 13th century, and received its municipal charter
from the landgrave Louis of Thuringia in 1227. On his death
it became the residence of his wife, Elizabeth of Hungary, who
built a hospital there, and died in 1231, at the age of twenty-four,
worn out with works of religion and charity. She was canonized
in 1235 at the instance of the Teutonic Knights, who had settled
in Marburg in 1233 and were zealous in promoting her cult. By
1247 Marburg had already become the second town of Hesse,
and in the 15th and 16th centuries it alternated with Cassel as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page681" id="page681"></a>681</span>
the seat of the landgraves. In 1529 the famous conference
between Luther and Zwingli on the subject of Transubstantiation
took place there in the Rittersaal of the Schloss (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Marburg,
Colloquy of</a></span>). During the Thirty Years&rsquo; and Seven Years&rsquo;
Wars Marburg suffered considerably from sieges and famine.
In 1806, and again in 1810, it was the centre of an abortive
rising against the French, in consequence of which the fortifications
of the castle were destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARBURG, COLLOQUY OF<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (<i>Marburger Religionsgespräch</i>),
the name given to a conference of divines held in 1529 in the
interests of the unity of Protestant Germany. The circumstances
in which it was held, the influence of the men who conducted its
deliberations, and the result of its proceedings, combine to render
it of no small importance for the history of the Reformation in
Germany.</p>

<p>After the Imperial Diet of Spires in 1526 had decreed that all
states of the empire should observe the Edict of Worms (1521),
banning Luther and his adherents, in such a manner that they
should not be afraid to answer it before God and the emperor,
the reform movement had received such an access of strength
that the Catholic party felt itself menaced in earnest, and in
1529 again passed a resolution at Spires, deigned not merely
to preclude any further expansion of the Reformation, but
even to prevent it from maintaining the ground already won.
This decision was at once challenged, on the 19th of April, by
the protest of the Evangelical states (whence the name Protestants);
and the effect of this disclaimer was not small. Still,
it was devoid of political significance, unless backed by the
united force of all the princes and states subscribing to the
Evangelical teaching; and this unity was wanting. The feud
which raged round the doctrine of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper had already
broken out before the first diet of Spires, and had aroused great
and immediate excitement. At a very early period, however,
efforts were made to allay the dissension. Strassburg pronounced
for conciliation: but the most powerful and zealous
champion of peace was to be found in the landgrave Philip
of Hesse, who recognized the absolute necessity&mdash;from a political
standpoint&mdash;of the union of all German Protestants. It is
probable that he had invited Luther to a religious conference
as early as the year 1527; but on that occasion he met with a
refusal. True, the impression conveyed by the attitude of the
Catholic party at the second Diet of Spires had served to awaken
the feeling for solidarity among the Evangelicals there assembled;
and on the 22nd of April they had even secured the basis for a
provisional alliance in the shape of a formula drawn up by
Bucer and dealing with the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. But it was obvious
that a permanent coalition could not be expected unless some
definite understanding on the debated point could be attained;
and on the very same day the landgrave despatched to Zwingli
an invitation to a colloquy, and received his prompt acquiescence.
Melanchthon, who in the tension which prevailed at the synod
had shown himself inclined to negotiation, became suspicious
on his return, and endeavoured to influence the elector of Saxony
and Luther in accordance with his views. The landgrave,
however, was so far successful that the beginning of October
(1529) saw the colloquy opened in the castle at Marburg. With
Zwingli, who had arrived on the 27th of September, he had
several interviews of considerable political importance before
the Wittenberg divines made their appearance. These interviews
settled the preliminaries of an alliance; but they rested
on the assumption that the theological feud between Wittenberg
and Zürich could be removed, or its violence at least abated.</p>

<p>The proceedings opened on the 1st of October with conferences
between Luther and Oecolampadius, and Melanchthon and
Zwingli: then on the two following days the discussion proper&mdash;confined
almost entirely to Luther and Zwingli&mdash;was held before
the landgrave and his guest Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, in
the presence of more than fifty persons. As regards the main
point of contention, <i>i.e.</i> the doctrine of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,
no agreement was found practicable; and the private conversations
on the 4th of October, which formed the sequel of the
debate, carried matters no farther. &ldquo;You have another spirit,&rdquo;
said Luther. Since the landgrave, however, was reluctant to
see the colloquy brought to an absolutely fruitless close, he
requested Luther to draw up a list of the most important points
of doctrine on which it might yet be possible to arrive at some
degree of unanimity. This was done on the 4th of October;
and a few alterations were introduced to meet the wishes of
the Swiss deputies. The <i>Articles of Marburg</i>, which thus came
into being, contain the doctrine of the Trinity, of the personality
of Christ, of faith and justification, of the Scriptures, of baptism,
of good works, of confession, of government, of tradition, and
of infant baptism. The fifteenth article, treating of the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper, defines the ground common to both parties even in this
debateable region, recognizing the necessity of participation in
both kinds, and rejecting the sacrifice of the Mass. It then
proceeds to fix the point of difference in the fact that no agreement
had been reached on the question &ldquo;whether the true body
and blood of Christ are corporeally present in the bread and
wine&rdquo; (&ldquo;Nit vergleicht haben wir uns, ob der war leib und
plut Christi leiblich im brot und wein sey&rdquo;). Nevertheless, the
adherents of each doctrine are recommended to display Christian
charity to those of the other. These articles were signed by
the ten official members of the colloquy: Luther, Jonas,
Melanchthon, Osiander, Agricola, Brenz, Oecolampadius, Bucer,
Hedio and Zwingli. The personal contact between Luther and
Zwingli led to no mental <i>rapprochement</i> between the two; but in
the following year the Articles of Marburg did good service as
one of the preliminaries to the Augsburg Confession, and remain
a valuable document for the fundamental principles common
to the Lutheran and Reformed Churches.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCA, PIERRE DE<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (1594-1662), French prelate and
historian, was born at Gan, near Pau, on the 24th of January
1594. His family was known among judicial circles in the
16th century, and maintained the Roman Catholic faith after
the official introduction of the Reformed religion into Navarre.
After having studied law at the university of Toulouse he
practised successfully at Pau. But he was ambitious, and
turned to a larger sphere. He ardently called for the armed
intervention of King Louis XIII. in Béarn, and on this occasion
published his first writing, <i>Discours d&rsquo;un Béarnais, très fidèle
sujet du roi, sur l&rsquo;édit du rétablissement de l&rsquo;exercice de la religion
catholique dans tout le Béarn</i> (1618). After the easy campaign
of 1620, the possessions which had been taken by the Protestants
were given back to the Roman Catholic church; this task was
performed, under his supervision, with judgment and moderation.
During the siege of La Rochelle he performed a mission
which brought him in touch with Richelieu, who shortly afterwards
nominated him <i>intendant de justice</i> in Béarn (1631),
and in 1639 summoned him to Paris with the title of counsellor
of state. The following year, the question of the intervention
of kings in the election of bishops having been raised in a pamphlet
by Charles Hersent (<i>Optalus Gallus de cavendo schismate</i>,
1640), Marca defended what were then called the liberties
of the Gallican Church, in his celebrated treatise <i>De concordia
sacerdotii et imperii, seu de libertalibus ecclesiae gallicanae</i> (1641).
He was soon rewarded for this service. Although he had not
yet taken even the minor holy orders, he was nominated bishop
of Couserans by the king on the 28th of December 1641, but
the pope refused to give his sanction. It was only after Marca
had formally denied those propositions contained in <i>De concordia</i>
which were displeasing to Rome that he was proclaimed
in the consistory (Jan. 13, 1648). During this time, and
until 1651, he was governor of the province of Catalonia, then
occupied by the French. After the Treaty of the Pyrenees,
he was sent to direct the conference which had been formed
to fix the limits of Roussillon, which had just been ceded to
France (1660). Marca now interested himself in the fortunes
of Mazarin, and remained faithful to him even during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page682" id="page682"></a>682</span>
Fronde. As a recompense, he was nominated archbishop
of Toulouse (May 28, 1652), but had to wait for the bulls of
investiture till the 23rd of March 1654. It was difficult for
him to please both pope and king. In the struggle against
the Jansenists he used all the influence he had with the clergy
to secure the passage of the apostolic constitution of the 31st
of March 1653 (<i>Relation de ce qui s&rsquo;est fait depuis 1653 dans
les assemblées des évêques au sujet des cinq propositions</i>, 1657);
but in the rebellion raised by Retz, archbishop of Paris, against
the king, he took the part of the king against the pope. Michel
Le Tellier having ordered him to refute a thesis of the college
of Clermont on the infallibility of the pope, Marca wrote a
treatise which was most Gallican in its ideas, but refused to
publish it for fear of drawing down &ldquo;the indignation of Rome.&rdquo;
These tactics were successful, and when Retz, weary of a struggle
without definite results, resigned the archbishopric, Marca
became his successor (Feb. 26, 1662). He did not derive
much profit from this new favour, as he died on the 29th of
June following, without his nomination having been sanctioned
by the pope.</p>

<p>Marca, clever and covetous, was also an historian of note.
When very young he showed his interest in the past history
of his native land, and in 1617, at the age of twenty-three, he
had set to work looking through archives, copying charters,
and corresponding with the principal men of learning of his
time, the brothers Dupuy, André Duchesne and Jean Besly,
whom he visited in Poitou. His <i>Histoire de Béarn</i> was published
at Paris in 1640. It was not so well received as his
<i>De concordia</i>, but is more appreciated by posterity. If Marca&rsquo;s
criticism is too often undecided, both in the ancient epochs,
where he supports the text by a certain amount of guesswork
and in certain points where he touches on religion, yet he always
gives the text correctly. A number of chapters end with an
interesting collection of charters. It is to be regretted that
this incomplete work does not go beyond 1300. During his
long stay in Catalonia he made preparations for a geographical
and historical description of this province, which was bound to
France by so many political and literary associations. Baluze,
who became his secretary in 1656, helped him with the work
and finished it, adding clever appendices and publishing the
whole in 1688 under the title <i>Marca hispanica</i>.</p>

<p>Marca married Marguerite de Forgues on the 4th of June
1618, and had one son and three daughters. His son,
Galactoire, who was president of the parlement of Navarre,
died on the 10th of February 1689.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Marca&rsquo;s biography was written in Latin by two of his intimate
friends, Étienne Baluze, his secretary (<i>Epistola ad Samuelem
Sorbierium, de vita, gestis et scriptis Petri de Marca</i>, Paris, 1663),
and his cousin, Paul de Faget (at the beginning of a collection of
Marca&rsquo;s theological pamphlets, first published by Paul de Faget in
1668). This contained four treatises on the Eucharist, the sacrifice
of the Mass, the erection of the patriarchate of Constantinople
(in Latin), and the sacrament of the Eucharist (in French). It was
supposed to contain heretical propositions and caused a good deal
of scandal, inciting Baluze against Faget, both of whom abused
the other, to defend the memory of the prelate.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCANTONIO<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Marcantonio Raimondi</span>], the chief Italian
master of the art of engraving in the age of the Renaissance,
and the first who practised it in order to reproduce, not
designs of his own invention, as earlier craftsmen had commonly
done, but those of other artists almost exclusively. The date
of his birth is uncertain, nor is there any good authority for
assigning it, as is commonly done, approximately to the year
1488. He was probably born some years at least earlier than
this, inasmuch as he is mentioned by a contemporary writer,
Achillini, as being an artist of repute in 1504. His earliest
dated plate, illustrating the story of Pyramus and Thisbe,
belongs to the following year, 1505. Marcantonio received
his training in the workshop of the famous goldsmith and
painter of Bologna, Francesco Raibolini, usually called Francia.
&ldquo;Having more aptitude in design,&rdquo; says Vasari, &ldquo;than his
master, and managing the graver with facility and grace, he
made waist-buckles and many other things in niello, such being
then greatly in fashion, and made them most beautifully,
as being in truth most excellent in that craft.&rdquo; The real fame,
however, of Marcantonio was destined to be founded on his
attainments, not in the goldsmith&rsquo;s art generally, but in that
particular development of it which consists of engraving designs
on metal plates for the purpose of reproduction by the printing
press. This art was not new in Italy in the days of Marcantonio&rsquo;s
apprenticeship. It had been practised, in a more or
less elementary form, for not less than forty or fifty years in
the workshops alike of Venetia, the Emilia, Tuscany and Lombardy.
But the technical aim of the Italian engravers had
not hitherto been directed, like that of Schongauer or Dürer
north of the Alps, towards securing such freedom and precision
in the use of the burin as should impart to the impressions
taken from their engraved plates both a striking decorative
effect and a power of suggesting to the eye a complex variety
of natural objects and surfaces in light and shade. The Italian
masters had been satisfied with much more rudimentary effects.
The Florentine primitives had been content either with very
simple cloudy patches of cross-hatching in fine straight lines,
or with broad open shadings in the manner of a bold pen-drawing.
Mantegna and Pollaiuolo, the two chief original masters who
practised the art, had used the latter method with great power
but at the same time great simplicity.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the 16th century a desire for a more
complicated kind of effects was already arising among the
followers of the art in Italy. Both backgrounds and passages
of foreground detail were often imitated, inartificially enough,
from the works of the northern masters. Marcantonio himself
was among the foremost in this movement. About eighty
engravings can be referred to the first five or six years of his
career (1505-1511). Their subjects are very various, including
many of pagan mythology, and some of obscure allegory,
along with those of Christian devotion. The types of figures
and drapery, and the general character of the compositions,
bespeak for the most part the inspiration, and sometimes the
direct authorship, of Francia. But the influence of German
example is very perceptible also, particularly in the landscape
backgrounds, and in the endeavour to express form by means
of light and shadow with greater freedom than had been hitherto
the practice of the southern schools. In a few subjects also
the figures themselves correspond to a coarse Teutonic, instead
of to the refined Italian, ideal. But so far we find Marcantonio
only indirectly leaning on the north for the sake of self-improvement.
It must have been for the sake of commercial
profit that he by-and-by produced a series of direct counterfeits
on copper from Albert Dürer&rsquo;s woodcuts. These facsimiles
are sixty-nine in number, including seventeen of Dürer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life
of the Virgin,&rdquo; thirty-seven of his &ldquo;Little Passion,&rdquo; on wood, and
a number of single pieces. According to Vasari, Dürer&rsquo;s indignation
over those counterfeits was the cause of his journey
to Venice, where he is said to have lodged a complaint against
Marcantonio, and induced the Senate to prohibit the counterfeiting
of his monogram, at any rate, upon any future imitations
of the kind. Vasari&rsquo;s account must certainly be mistaken,
inasmuch as Dürer&rsquo;s journey to Venice took place in 1506,
and neither of the two series of woodcuts imitated by Marcantonio
was published until 1511. The greater part of the designs
for the &ldquo;Life of the Virgin&rdquo; had, it is true, been made and engraved
seven years earlier than the date of their publication; and
it is to be remarked that, whereas Marcantonio&rsquo;s copies of the
&ldquo;Little Passion&rdquo; leave out the monogram of Dürer, it is inserted
in his copies of the &ldquo;Life of the Virgin&rdquo;; whence it would, after
all, seem possible that he had seen and counterfeited a set of
impressions of this series at the time when they were originally
executed, and before their publication. But the real nature
of the transaction, if transaction there was, which took place
between Dürer and Marcantonio we cannot now hope to
recover. Enough that the Bolognese engraver evidently
profited, both in money and in education of the hand, by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page683" id="page683"></a>683</span>
work in imitating in a finer material the energetic characters
of these northern woodcuts. He was soon to come under
a totally different influence, and to turn the experience he
had gained to account in interpreting the work of a master
of a quite other stamp. Up till the year 1510 Marcantonio
had lived entirely at Bologna, with the exception, it would
appear, of a visit or visits to Venice. (A few of his early engravings
are from drawings of the school of Giorgione.) Very
soon afterwards he was attracted, for good and all, into the
circle which surrounded Raphael at Rome. Where or when
he had first made Raphael&rsquo;s acquaintance is uncertain. His
passage to Rome by way of Florence has been supposed to
be marked by an engraving, dated 1510, and known as &ldquo;The
Climbers,&rdquo; <i>Les Grimpeurs</i> (Bartsch, 487), in which he has reproduced
a portion of the design of Michelangelo&rsquo;s cartoon
of the Soldiers surprised bathing, and has added behind the
figures a landscape imitated from the then young Dutch
engraver Lucas of Leiden. Contemporary or somewhat earlier
than this is a large engraving done by him from a design by
Baldassare Peruzzi, a Sienese artist drawn about the same
time into the Raphael circle. The piece in which he is recorded
to have first tried his hand after Raphael himself is the Lucretia
(Bartsch 192). From that time until he disappears in the
catastrophe of 1527, Marcantonio was almost exclusively
engaged in reproducing by means of engraving the designs of
Raphael or of his immediate pupils. Raphael, the story goes,
was so delighted with the print of the Lucretia that he personally
trained and helped Marcantonio afterwards. A printing
establishment was set up under the charge of Raphael&rsquo;s colour-grinder,
Il Baviera, and the profits, in the early stage of the
business, were shared between the engraver and the printer.
The sale soon became very great; pupils gathered round about
Marcantonio, of whom the two most distinguished were Marco
Dente, known as Marco da Ravenna, and Agostino de&rsquo; Musi,
known as Agostino Veneziano; and he and they, during the
last ten years of Raphael&rsquo;s life, and for several years following
his death, gave forth a great profusion of engravings after the
master&rsquo;s work&mdash;not copying, in most instances, his finished
paintings, but working up, with the addition of simple backgrounds
and accessories, his first sketches and trials, which
often give the composition in a different form from the finished
work, and are all the more interesting on that account.</p>

<p>The best of these engravings produced in the workshop
of Marcantonio&mdash;those, namely, done by his own hand, and
especially those done during the first few years after he had
attached himself to Raphael&mdash;count among the most prized
and coveted examples of the art. In them he enters into the
genius of his master, and loses little of the chastened science
and rhythmical purity of Raphael&rsquo;s contours, or of the inspired
and winning sentiment of his faces; while in the parts where
he is left to himself&mdash;the rounding and shading, the background
and landscape&mdash;he manages his burin with all the
skill and freedom which he had gained by the imitation of
northern models, but puts away the northern emphasis and
redundance of detail. His work, however, does not long remain
at the height marked by pieces like the Lucretia, the Dido,
the Judgment of Paris, the Poetry, the Philosophy, or the
first Massacre of the Innocents. Marcantonio&rsquo;s engravings
after the works of Raphael&rsquo;s later years are cold, ostentatious,
and soulless by comparison. Still more so, as is natural, were
those which he and his pupils produced after the designs of
the degenerate scholars of Raphael and Michelangelo, of a
Giulio Romano, a Polidoro, or a Bandinelli. Marcantonio&rsquo;s
association with Giulio Romano was the cause of his first great
disaster in life. He engraved a series of obscene designs
by that painter in illustration of the <i>Sonnetti lussuriosi</i>
of Pietro Aretino, and thereby incurred the anger of pope
Clement VII., at whose order he was thrown into prison.
Marcantonio&rsquo;s ruin was completed by the calamities attendant
on the sack of Rome in 1527. He had to pay a heavy ransom
in order to escape from the hands of the Spaniards, and fled
from Rome, in the words of Vasari, &ldquo;all but a beggar.&rdquo; It
is said that he took refuge in his native city, Bologna; but he
never again emerges from obscurity, and all we know with
certainty is that in 1534 he was dead.</p>

as pyrites, being iron disulphide FeS<span class="su">2</span>, but crystallizing in the
orthorhombic instead of in the cubic system. The name is of
Arabic origin and was long applied to crystallized pyrites (<i>q.v.</i>);
it was restricted to the present species by W. Haidinger in
1845. The mineral was known to G. Agricola in 1546 under
the names <i>Wasserkies</i> or <i>Weisserkies</i> and <i>Leberkies</i>, and it
has been variously known as white pyrites, hepatic pyrites,
lamellar pyrites, radiated pyrites (German <i>Strahlkies</i>) and
prismatic pyrites. The orthorhombic form of the crystals,
as distinct from the cubic form of pyrites, was recognized by
Romé de l&rsquo;Isle in 1772, though later R. J. Haüy considered
the crystals to be only distorted cubic forms.</p>

</table>

<p>The crystals are isomorphous with mispickel (<i>q.v.</i>), but only
rarely are they distinctly developed and simple (fig.). Usually
they are twinned on a prism plane, M, producing
pentagonal stellate groups of five
crystals; twinning on the plain g, in which
the crystals intercross at angles of nearly
60°, is less common. This frequent twinning
gives rise to characteristic forms, with many
re-entrant angles, to which the names &ldquo;spear
pyrites&rdquo; and &ldquo;cockscomb pyrites&rdquo; are applied.
The commonest state of aggregation is that of radially arranged
fibres, the external surface of the mass being globular, nodular
or stalactitic in form.</p>

<p>Apart from crystalline form, the external characters of
marcasite are very similar to those of pyrites, and when distinct
crystals are not available the two species cannot always be
easily distinguished. The colour is usually pale bronze-yellow,
often rather lighter than that of pyrites; on freshly fractured
surfaces of pure marcasite the colour is tin-white, but this
rapidly tarnishes on exposure to air. The lustre is metallic
and brilliant. The streak is greyish or brownish-black. The
hardness (6-6<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>) is the same as that of pyrites, and the specific
gravity (4.8-4.9) as a rule rather less. Arsenical varieties
of marcasite, containing up to 5% of arsenic, are known as
lonchidite and kyrosite.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Marcasite readily oxidizes on exposure to moist air, with the
production of sulphuric acid and a white fibrous efflorescence of
ferrous sulphate, and in course of time specimens in collections
often became completely disintegrated. In nature it is frequently
altered to limonite with the separation of native sulphur. Marcasite
is thus the less stable of the two modifications of iron disulphide.
Many experiments have been made with a view to determining the
difference in chemical constitution of marcasite and pyrites, but
with no very definite results. It is a noteworthy fact that whilst
pyrites has been prepared artificially, marcasite has not.</p>

<p>Marcasite occurs under the same conditions as pyrites, but is
much less common. Whilst pyrites is found abundantly in the
older crystalline rocks and slates, marcasite is more abundant in
clays, and has often been formed as a concretion around organic
remains. It is abundant, for example, in the plastic clay of the
Brown Coal formation at Littmitz, near Carlsbad, in Bohemia, at
which place it has been extensively mined for the manufacture of
sulphur and ferrous sulphate. In the Chalk of the south-east of
England nodules of marcasite with a fibrous radiated structure
are abundant, and in the Chalk Marl between Dover and Folkestone
fine twinned groups of &ldquo;spear pyrites&rdquo; are common. The mineral
is also met with in metalliferous veins, though much less frequently
than pyrites; for example the &ldquo;cockscomb pyrites&rdquo; of the lead
mines of Derbyshire and Cumberland.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCEAU-DESGRAVIERS, FRANÇOIS SÉVERIN<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> (1769-1796),
French general, was born at Chartres on the 1st of March
1769. His father was a law officer, and he was educated for
a legal career, but at the age of sixteen he enlisted in the regiment
of Savoy-Carignan. Whilst on furlough in Paris Marceau
joined in the attack on the Bastille (July 14, 1789); after
that event he took his discharge from the regular army and
returned to Chartres, but the embarrassments of his family
soon compelled him to seek fresh military employment. He
became drill instructor, and afterwards captain in the departmental
(Eure-et-Loire) regiment of the National Guard. Early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page684" id="page684"></a>684</span>
in March 1792 he was elected lieutenant-colonel of one of the
battalions of the Eure-et-Loire; he took part in the defence of
Verdun in 1792, and it fell to his lot to bear the proposals of
capitulation to the Prussian camp. The spiritless conduct
of the defenders excited the wrath of the revolutionary authorities,
and Marceau was fortunate in escaping arrest and finding
re-employment as a captain in the regular service. Early
in 1793 he became with other officers &ldquo;suspect,&rdquo; and was
for some time imprisoned. On his release he hurried to take
part in the defence of Saumur against the Vendéan royalists,
and distinguished himself at the combat of Saumur (June 10,
1793) by gallantly rescuing the representative Bourbotte from
the hands of the insurgents. The Convention voted him the
thanks of the country, and thenceforward his rise was rapid.
His conduct at Chantonnay (Sept. 5) won him the provisional
rank of general of brigade. On the 17th of October he bore
a great part in the victory of Cholet, and on the field of
this battle began his friendship with Kléber. For the victory
of Cholet Kléber was made general of division and Marceau
confirmed as general of brigade. Their advice was of the
greatest value to the generals in command, and the military
talents of each were the complement of the other&rsquo;s. Marceau,
who became general of division (Nov. 10), succeeded to the
chief command <i>ad interim</i>, and with his friend won important
victories near Le Mans (Dec 12-13) and Savenay (Dec. 23).
After the battle of Le Mans, Marceau rescued and protected
a young Royalist lady, Angélique des Mesliers. It is often
supposed that he was in love with his prisoner; but the
help even of the commander-in-chief did not avail to save
her from the guillotine (Jan. 22, 1794). Marceau had
already retired from the war, exhausted by the fatigues of
the campaign, and he and Kléber were saved from arrest and
execution only by the intervention of Bourbotte. Marceau
became affianced about this time to Agathe Leprêtre de
Châteaugiron, but his constant military employment, his
broken health, and the opposition of the comte de Châteaugiron
on the one hand and of Marceau&rsquo;s devoted half-sister
&ldquo;Emira,&rdquo; wife of the Republican politician Sergent, on the
other, prevented the realization of his hopes. After spending
the winter of 1793-1794 in Paris he took a command in the
army under Jourdan, in which Kléber also served. He took part
in the various battles about Charleroi, and at the final victory
of Fleurus (June 26, 1794) he had a horse shot under him.
He distinguished himself again at Jülich and at Aldenhoven,
and stormed the fines of Coblenz on the 23rd of October. With
the Army of the Sambre and Meuse he took his share in the
campaign of 1795 on the Rhine and the Lahn, distinguishing
himself particularly with Kléber in the fighting about Neuwied
on the 18th and 19th of October, and at Sulzbach on the 17th
of December. In the campaign of 1796 the famous invasion
of Germany by the armies of Jourdan and Moreau ended in
disaster, and Marceau&rsquo;s men covered Jourdan&rsquo;s retreat over
the Rhine. He fought the desperate actions on the Lahn
(Sept. 16 and 18), and at Altenkirchen on the 19th received
a mortal wound, of which he died on the 21st, at the early
age of twenty-seven. The Austrians vied with his own
countrymen in doing honour to the dead general. His body
was burned, and his ashes, which at the time were placed
under a pyramid designed by Kléber, were transferred in 1889
to the Pantheon at Paris.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCEL, ÉTIENNE<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (d. 1358), provost of the merchants
of Paris under King John II., belonged by birth to the wealthy
Parisian <i>bourgeoisie</i>, being the son of a clothier named Simon
Marcel and of Isabelle Barbou. He is mentioned as provost
of the Grande-Confrérie of Notre Dame in 1350, and in 1354
he succeeded Jean de Pacy as provost of the Parisian merchants.
His political career began in 1356, when John was made prisoner
after the battle of Poitiers. In conjunction with Robert le
Coq, bishop of Laon, he played a leading part in the states-general
called together by the dauphin Charles on the 17th
of October. A committee of eighty members, constituted
on their initiative, pressed their demands with such insistence
that the dauphin prorogued the states-general; but financial
straits obliged him to summon them once more on the 3rd
of February 1357, and the promulgation of a great edict of
reform was the consequence. John the Good forbade its
being put into effect, whereupon a conflict began between
Marcel and the dauphin, Marcel endeavouring to set up Charles
the Bad, king of Navarre, in opposition to him. The states-general
assembled again on the 13th of January 1358, and on
the 22nd of February the populace of Paris, led by Marcel,
invaded the palace and murdered the marshals of Champagne
and Normandy before the prince&rsquo;s eyes. Thenceforward
Marcel was in open hostility to the throne. After vainly
hoping that the insurrection of the Jacquerie might turn to
his advantage, he next supported the king of Navarre, whose
armed bands infested the neighbourhood of Paris. On the
night of the 31st of July Marcel was about to open the gates
of the capital to them, but Jean Maillart prevented the execution
of this design, and killed him before the Porte Saint-Antoine.
During the following days his adherents were likewise put to
death, and the dauphin was enabled to re-enter Paris. Étienne
Marcel married first Jeanne de Dammartin, and secondly
Marguerite des Essars, who survived him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCELLINUS, ST,<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> according to the Liberian catalogue,
became bishop of Rome on the 30th of June, 296; his predecessor
was Caius or Gaius. He is not mentioned in the
<i>Martyrologium hieronymianum</i>, or in the <i>Depositio episcoporum</i>,
or in the <i>Depositio martyrum</i>. The <i>Liber pontificalis</i>, basing
itself on the Acts of St Marcellinus, the text of which is lost,
relates that during Diocletian&rsquo;s persecution Marcellinus was
called upon to sacrifice, and offered incense to idols, but that,
repenting shortly afterwards, he confessed the faith of Christ
and suffered martyrdom with several companions. Other
documents speak of his defection, and it is probably this lapse
that explains the silence of the ancient liturgical calendars. In
the beginning of the 5th century Petilianus, the Donatist
bishop of Constantine, affirmed that Marcellinus and his priests
had given up the holy books to the pagans during the persecution
and offered incense to false gods. St Augustine contents
himself with denying the affair (<i>Contra litt. Petiliani</i>, ii. 202;
<i>De unico baptismo</i>, 27). The records of the pseudo-council
of Sinuessa, which were fabricated at the beginning of the
6th century, state that Marcellinus after his fall presented
himself before a council, which refused to try him on the ground
that <i>prima sedes a nemine iudicatur</i>. According to the <i>Liber
pontificalis</i>, Marcellinus was buried, on the 26th of April 304,
in the cemetery of Priscilla, on the Via Salaria, 25 days after his
martyrdom; the Liberian catalogue gives as the date the 25th
of October. The fact of the martyrdom, too, is not established
with certainty. After a considerable interregnum he was
succeeded by Marcellus, with whom he has sometimes been
confounded.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCELLO, BENEDETTO<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (1686-1739), Italian musical
composer, was born in 1686, either on the 31st of July or on
the 1st of August. He was of noble family (in his compositions
he is frequently described as &ldquo;Patrizio Veneto&rdquo;), and although
a pupil of Lotti and Gasparini, was intended by his father to
devote himself to the law. In 1711 he was a member of the
Council of Forty, and in 1730 went to Pola as Provveditore.
His health having been impaired by the climate of Istria,
he retired after eight years to Brescia in the capacity of Camerlengo,
and died there on the 24th of July 1739.</p>

<p>Marcello is best remembered by his <i>Estro poetico-armonico</i>
(Venice, 1724-1727), a musical setting for voices and strings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page685" id="page685"></a>685</span>
of the first fifty Psalms, as paraphrased in Italian by G. Giustiniani.
They were much admired by Charles Avison, who
with John Garth brought out an edition with English words
(London, 1757). Some extracts are to be found in Hawkins&rsquo;s
<i>History of Music</i>. His other works are chiefly cantatas, either
for one voice or several; the library of the Brussels conservatoire
possesses some interesting volumes of chamber-cantatas
composed for his mistress. Although he produced an opera,
<i>La Fede riconosciuta</i>, at Vicenza in 1702, he had little sympathy
with this form of composition, and vented his opinions on the
state of musical drama at the time in the satirical pamphlet
<i>Il Teatro alla moda</i>, published anonymously in Venice in 1720.
This little work, which was frequently reprinted, is not only
extremely amusing, but is also most valuable as a contribution
to the history of opera.</p>

banished from Rome in 309 on account of the tumult caused by
the severity of the penances he had imposed on Christians
who had lapsed under the recent persecution. He died the
same year, being succeeded by Eusebius. He is commemorated
on the 16th of January.</p>

was born on the 6th of May 1501, and was elected pope on
the 9th of April 1555. He had long been identified with the
rigorist party in the church, and as president of the Council
of Trent had incurred the anger of the emperor by his jealous
defence of papal prerogative. His motives were lofty, his
life blameless, his plans for reform nobly conceived. But
death removed him (April 30, 1555) before he could do more
than give an earnest of his intentions. He was followed by
Paul IV.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCELLUS,<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> a Roman plebeian family belonging to the
Claudian gens. Its most distinguished members were the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</span> (<i>c.</i> 268-208 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), one of the
Roman generals during the Second Punic War and conqueror of
Syracuse. He first served against Hamilcar in Sicily. In his
first consulship (222) he was engaged, with Cn. Cornelius Scipio
as colleague, in war against the Insubrian Gauls, and won the
<i>spolia opima</i> for the third and last time in Roman history by
slaying their chief Viridomarus or Virdumarus (Polybius ii. 34;
Propertius v. 10, 39). In 216, after the defeat at Cannae, he
took command of the remnant of the army at Canusium, and
although he was unable to prevent Capua going over to Hannibal,
he saved Nola and southern Campania. In 214 he was in Sicily
as consul at the time of the revolt of Syracuse; he stormed
Leontini and besieged Syracuse, but the skill of Archimedes
repelled his attacks. After a two years&rsquo; siege he gradually forced
his way into the city and took it in the face of strong Punic
reinforcements. He spared the lives of the inhabitants, but
carried off their art treasures to Rome, the first instance of a
practice afterwards common. Consul again in 210, he took
Salapia in Apulia, which had revolted to Hannibal, by help of
the Roman party there, and put to death the Numidian garrison.
Proconsul in 209, he attacked Hannibal near Venusia, and after
a desperate battle retired to that town; he was accused of bad
generalship, and had to leave the army to defend himself in
Rome. In his last consulship (208), he and his colleague, while
reconnoitring near Venusia, were unexpectedly attacked, and
Marcellus was killed. His successes have been exaggerated
by Livy, but the name often given to him, the &ldquo;sword of Rome,&rdquo;
was well deserved.</p>

Appian, <i>Hannib.</i> 50; Florus ii. 6.</p>
</div>

<p>2. <span class="sc">M. Claudius Marcellus</span>, an inveterate opponent of
Julius Caesar. During his consulship (51 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) he proposed to
remove Caesar from his army in March 49, but this decision
was delayed by Pompey&rsquo;s irresolution and the skilful opposition
of the tribune C. Curio (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Caesar, Julius</a></span>). In January 49
he tried to put off declaring war against Caesar till an army
could be got ready, but his advice was not taken. When Pompey
left Italy, Marcus and his brother Gaius followed, while his
cousin withdrew to Liternum. After Pharsalus M. Marcellus
retired to Mytilene, where he practised rhetoric and studied
philosophy. In 46 his cousin and the senate successfully appealed
to Caesar to pardon him, and Marcellus reluctantly consented
to return. On this occasion Cicero&rsquo;s<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> speech <i>Pro Marcello</i> was
delivered. Marcellus left for Italy, but was murdered in May
by one of his own attendants, P. Magius Chilo, in the Peiraeus.
Marcellus was a thorough aristocrat. He was an eloquent
speaker (Cicero, <i>Brutus</i>, 71), and a man of firm character,
although not free from avarice.</p>

<p>3. <span class="sc">M. Claudius Marcellus</span> (<i>c.</i> 43-23 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), son of C. Marcellus

emperor and married to his daughter Julia. This seemed to
mark him out as the heir to the throne, but Augustus, when
attacked by a serious illness, gave his signet to M. Vipsanius
Agrippa. In 23 Marcellus, then curule aedile, died at Baiae.
Livia was suspected of having poisoned him to get the empire
for her son Tiberius. Great hopes had been built on the youth,
and he was celebrated by many writers, especially by Virgil
in a famous passage (<i>Aeneid</i>, vi. 860). He was buried in the
Campus Martius, and Augustus himself pronounced the funeral
oration. The Theatrum Marcelli (remains of which can still be
seen) was afterwards dedicated in his honour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCH, EARLS OF,<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> title derived from the &ldquo;marches&rdquo; or
boundaries (1) between England and Wales, and (2) England
and Scotland, and held severally by great feudal families possessed
of lands in those border districts. The earls of March on
the Welsh borders were descended from Roger de Mortemer (so
called from his castle of Mortemer in Normandy), who was
connected by marriage with the dukes of Normandy. His son
Ralph (d. <i>c.</i> 1104) figures in Domesday as the holder of vast
estates in Shropshire, Herefordshire and other parts of England,
especially in the west; and his grandson Hugh de Mortimer,
founder of the priory of Wigmore in Herefordshire, was one
of the most powerful of the barons reduced to submission by
Henry II., who compelled him to surrender his castles of Cleobury
and Wigmore. The Mortimers, however, continued to exercise
almost undisputed sway, as lords of Wigmore, over the western
counties and the Welsh marches.</p>

<p>I. <i>Welsh Marches.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Roger de Mortimer</span> (<i>c.</i> 1286-1330), 8th
baron of Wigmore and 1st earl of March, being an infant at the
death of his father, Edmund, was placed by Edward I. under the
guardianship of Piers Gaveston, and was knighted by Edward in
1306; Mortimer&rsquo;s mother being a relative of Edward&rsquo;s consort,
Eleanor of Castile. Through his marriage with Joan de Joinville,
or Genevill, Roger not only acquired increased possessions
on the Welsh marches, including the important castle of Ludlow,
which became the chief stronghold of the Mortimers, but also
extensive estates and influence in Ireland, whither he went in
1308 to enforce his authority. This brought him into conflict
with the De Lacys, who turned for support to Edward Bruce,
brother of Robert Bruce, king of Scotland. Mortimer was
appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland by Edward II. in 1316,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page686" id="page686"></a>686</span>
and at the head of a large army drove Bruce to Carrickfergus,
and the De Lacys into Connaught, wreaking vengeance on their
adherents whenever they were to be found. He was then occupied
for some years with baronial disputes on the Welsh border
until about 1318, when he began to interest himself in the growing
opposition to Edward II. and his favourites, the Despensers;
and he supported Humphrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford, in
refusing to obey the king&rsquo;s summons to appear before him in
1321. Forced to surrender to the king at Shrewsbury in January
1322, Mortimer was consigned to the Tower of London, whence
he escaped to France in August 1324. In the following year
Isabella, wife of Edward II., anxious to escape from her husband,
obtained his consent to her going to France to use her influence
with her brother, Charles IV., in favour of peace. At the French
court the queen found Roger Mortimer; she became his mistress
soon afterwards, and at his instigation refused to return to England
so long as the Despensers retained power as the king&rsquo;s
favourites. The scandal of Isabella&rsquo;s relations with Mortimer
compelled them both to withdraw from the French court to
Flanders, where they obtained assistance for an invasion of
England. Landing in England in September 1326, they were
joined by Henry, earl of Lancaster; London rose in support of
the queen; and Edward took flight to the west, whither he was
pursued by Mortimer and Isabella. After wandering helplessly
for some weeks in Wales, the king was taken on the 16th of
November, and was compelled to abdicate in favour of his son.
But though the latter was crowned as Edward III. in January
1327, the country was ruled by Mortimer and Isabella, who procured
the murder of Edward II. in the following September.
Rich estates and offices of profit and power were now heaped on
Mortimer, and in September 1328 he was created earl of March.
Greedy and grasping, he was no more competent than the Despensers
to conduct the government of the country. The jealousy
and anger of Lancaster having been excited by March&rsquo;s arrogance,
Lancaster prevailed upon the young king, Edward III., to throw
off the yoke of his mother&rsquo;s paramour. At a parliament held
at Nottingham in October 1330 a plot was successfully carried
out by which March was arrested in the castle, and, in spite
of Isabella&rsquo;s entreaty to her son to &ldquo;have pity on the gentle
Mortimer,&rdquo; was conveyed to the Tower. Accused of assuming
royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was
condemned without trial and hanged at Tyburn on the 29th of
November 1330, his vast estates being forfeited to the crown.
March&rsquo;s wife, by whom he had four sons and eleven daughters,
survived till 1356. The daughters all married into powerful
families, chiefly of Marcher houses. His eldest son, Edmund,
was father of Roger Mortimer (<i>c.</i> 1328-1360), who was knighted
by Edward III. in 1346, and restored to his grandfather&rsquo;s title
as 2nd earl of March.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Edmund de Mortimer</span> (1351-1381), 3rd earl of March, was
son of Roger, 2nd earl of March, by his wife Philippa, daughter
of William Montacute, 1st earl of Salisbury. Being an infant
at the death of his father, Edmund, as a ward of the crown, was
placed by Edward III. under the care of William of Wykeham
and Richard Fitzalan, earl of Arundel. The position of the
young earl, powerful on account of his possessions and hereditary
influence in the Welsh marches, was rendered still more important
by his marriage in 1368 to Philippa, only daughter of
Lionel, duke of Clarence, third son of Edward III. Lionel&rsquo;s
wife was Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of William de Burgh,
6th Lord of Connaught and 3rd earl of Ulster, and Lionel had
himself been created earl of Ulster before his marriage. The
earl of March, therefore, not only became the representative
of one of the chief Anglo-Norman lordships in Ireland in right
of his wife Philippa, but the latter, on the death of her father
shortly after her marriage, stood next in succession to the
crown after the Black Prince and his sickly son Richard, afterwards
king Richard II. This marriage had, therefore, far-reaching
consequences in the history of England, giving rise to the
claim of the house of York to the crown of England, contested
in the War of the Roses; Edward IV. being descended from the
third son of Edward III. as great-great-grandson of Philippa,
countess of March, and in the male line from Edmund, duke of
York, fifth son of Edward III.</p>

<p>Mortimer, now styled earl of March and Ulster, became
marshal of England in 1369, and was employed in various
diplomatic missions during the next following years. He was a
member of the committee appointed by the Peers to confer with
the Commons in 1373&mdash;the first instance of such a joint conference
since the institution of representative parliaments&mdash;on
the question of granting supplies for John of Gaunt&rsquo;s war in
France; and in the opposition to Edward III. and the court
party, which grew in strength towards the end of the reign,
March took the popular side, being prominent in the Good Parliament
of 1376 among the lords who, encouraged by the Prince of
Wales, concerted an attack upon the court party led by John of
Gaunt. The Speaker of the Commons in this parliament was
March&rsquo;s steward, Peter de la Mare; he firmly withstood John
of Gaunt in stating the grievances of the Commons, in supporting
the impeachment of several high court officials, and in procuring
the banishment of the king&rsquo;s mistress, Alice Perrers. March
was a member of the administrative council appointed by the
same parliament after the death of the Black Prince to attend
the king and advise him in all public affairs. On the accession
of Richard II., a minor, in 1377, the earl became a member of
the standing council of government; though as father of the
heir-presumptive to the crown he wisely abstained from claiming
any actually administrative office. The most powerful person
in the realm was, however, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster,
whose jealousy of March led to the acceptance by the latter of
the lieutenancy of Ireland in 1379. March succeeded in asserting
his authority in eastern Ulster, but failed to subdue the O&rsquo;Neills
farther west. Proceeding to Munster to put down the turbulency
of the chieftains of the south, March died at Cork on the
27th of December 1381. He was buried in Wigmore Abbey, of
which he had been a benefactor, and where his wife Philippa
who died about the same time was also interred. The earl had
two sons and two daughters, the elder of whom, Elizabeth,
married Henry Percy (Hotspur), son of the earl of Northumberland.
His eldest son Roger succeeded him as 4th earl of March
and Ulster. His second son Edmund (1376-1409) played an
important part in conjunction with his brother-in-law Hotspur
against Owen Glendower; but afterwards joined the latter, whose
daughter he married about 1402.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Roger de Mortimer</span>, 4th earl of March and Ulster (1374-1398),
son of the 3rd earl, succeeded to the titles and estates of
his family when a child of seven, and a month afterwards he was
appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, his uncle Sir Thomas
Mortimer acting as his deputy. Being a ward of the Crown,
his guardian was the earl of Kent, half-brother to Richard II.; and
in 1388 he married Kent&rsquo;s daughter, Eleanor. The importance
which he owed to his hereditary influence and possessions, and
especially to his descent from Edward III., was immensely
increased when Richard II. publicly acknowledged him as heir-presumptive
to the crown in 1385. In 1394 he accompanied
Richard to Ireland, but notwithstanding a commission from the
king as lieutenant of the districts over which he exercised nominal
authority by hereditary right, he made little headway against
the native Irish chieftains. March enjoyed great popularity
in England though he took no active part in opposing the despotic
measures of the king; in Ireland he illegally assumed the
native Irish costume. In August 1398 he was killed in fight
with an Irish clan, and was buried in Wigmore Abbey.
March&rsquo;s daughter Anne married Richard earl of Cambridge,
son of Edmund duke of York, fifth son of Edward III.; their
son Richard, duke of York, was father of King Edward IV., who
thus derived his title to the crown and acquired the estates of the
house of Mortimer.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Edmund de Mortimer</span> (1391-1425), 5th earl of March and
Ulster, son of the 4th earl, succeeded to his father&rsquo;s claim to the
crown as well as to his title and estates on the death of the latter
in Ireland in 1398. In the following year Richard II. was deposed
and the crown seized by Henry of Lancaster. The young
earl of March and his brother Roger were then kept in custody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page687" id="page687"></a>687</span>
by Henry IV., who, however, treated them honourably, until
March 1405, when they were carried off from Windsor Castle by
the opponents of the Lancastrian dynasty, of whom their uncle
Sir Edmund Mortimer (see above) and his brother-in-law Henry
Percy (Hotspur) were leaders in league with Owen Glendower.
The boys were recaptured, and in 1409 were committed to the
care of the prince of Wales. On the accession of the latter as
Henry V., in 1413, the earl of March was set at liberty and
restored to his estates, his brother Roger having died some years
previously; and he continued to enjoy the favour of the king
in spite of a conspiracy in 1415 to place him on the throne, in
which his brother-in-law, the earl of Cambridge, played the
leading part. March accompanied Henry V. throughout his
wars in France, and on the king&rsquo;s death in 1422 became a member
of the council of regency. He died in Ireland in 1425, and as he
left no issue the earldom of March in the house of Mortimer
became extinct, the estates passing to the last earl&rsquo;s nephew
Richard, who in 1435 was officially styled duke of York, earl of
March and Ulster, and baron of Wigmore. Richard&rsquo;s son Edward
having ascended the throne in 1461 as Edward IV., the earldom
of March became merged in the crown.</p>

<p>II. <i>Scottish Marches.</i>&mdash;The Scottish earls of March were
descended from Crinan, whose son Maldred married Algitha,
daughter of Ughtred, earl of Northumberland, by Elgiva,
daughter of the Saxon king Æthelred. Maldred&rsquo;s son Cospatrick,
or Gospatrick, was made earl of Northumberland by William
the Conqueror; but being soon afterwards deprived of this
position he fled to Scotland, where Malcolm Canmore, king of
Scotland, welcomed him and granted him Dunbar and the adjoining
lands. Two generations of Cospatricks followed in lineal
succession, bearing the title of earl, but without territorial designation.
Cospatrick II. witnessed the charter of Alexander I.
founding the abbey of Scone in 1115. The 3rd earl, also named
Cospatrick, a liberal benefactor of Melrose Abbey, died in 1166,
leaving two sons, the younger of whom was the ancestor of the
earls of Home. The elder son, Waltheof, was the first of
the family to be styled &ldquo;Comes de Dunbar,&rdquo; about the year
1174. His importance is proved by the fact that he was one
of the hostages for the performance of the Treaty of Falaise
for the liberation of William the Lion in 1175. Waltheof&rsquo;s son
Patrick Dunbar (the name Dunbar, derived from the family
estates, now becoming an hereditary surname), styled 5th earl of
Dunbar, although his father had been the first to adopt the
territorial designation, was keeper of Berwick Castle, and married
Ada, natural daughter of William the Lion. His grandson Patrick,
7th earl, headed the party that liberated King Alexander III.
in 1255 from the Comyns, and in the same year was nominated
guardian of the king and queen by the Treaty of Roxburgh.
He signed the Treaty of Perth (July 6, 1266) by which Magnus VI.
of Norway ceded the Isle of Man and the Hebrides to Scotland.
His wife was Christian, daughter of Robert Bruce, the
competitor for the crown of Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Patrick Dunbar</span>, 8th earl of Dunbar and 1st earl of March,
claimed the crown of Scotland in 1291 as descendant of Ada,
daughter of William the Lion. He was one of the &ldquo;seven earls
of Scotland,&rdquo; a distinct body separate from the other estates of
the realm, who claimed the right to elect a king in cases of disputed
succession, and whose authority was, perhaps, to be traced
to the seven provinces of the Pictish kingdom. He was the first
of the earls of Dunbar to appear in the records as &ldquo;comes de
Marchia,&rdquo; or earl of March. Like most of his family in later
times, he was favourable to the English interest in Scottish
affairs, and he did homage to Edward I. of England. His wife
Marjory, daughter of Alexander Comyn, earl of Buchan, took
the other side and held the castle of Dunbar for Baliol, but was
forced to surrender it to Edward in 1296. In 1298 he was
appointed the English king&rsquo;s lieutenant in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Patrick Dunbar</span> (1285-1369), 9th earl of Dunbar and 2nd
earl of March, son of the preceding, gave refuge to Edward II.
of England after Bannockburn, and contrived his escape by
sea to England. Later, he made peace with Robert Bruce,
and by him was appointed governor of Berwick Castle, which he
held against Edward III. until the defeat of the Scots at Halidon
Hill (July 19, 1333) made it no longer tenable. His countess,
known in Scottish history and romance as &ldquo;Black Agnes,&rdquo;
daughter of Thomas Randolph, earl of Moray (Murray), and
grandniece of Robert Bruce, is famous for her defence of Dunbar
Castle against the English under the earl of Salisbury in 1338,
Salisbury being forced to abandon the attempt after a fierce
siege lasting nineteen weeks. This lady succeeded to the estates
and titles of her brother, John Randolph, 3rd earl of Moray.
The earldom of Moray passed after her death to her second son,
John Dunbar, who married Marjory, daughter of King Robert II.
Black Agnes also bore to the earl of March two daughters,
the elder of whom, Agnes, after being the mistress of King
David II., married Sir James Douglas, lord of Dalkeith, from
whom were descended the first three earls of Morton; the
younger, Elizabeth, married John Maitland of Lethington,
ancestor of the duke of Lauderdale, whose second title was
marquess of March.</p>

<p><span class="sc">George Dunbar</span> (d. 1420), 10th earl of Dunbar and 3rd earl
of March, great-nephew of the 8th earl and warden of the
marches, accompanied Douglas in his foray into England in
1388, and commanded the Scots after Otterburn. He afterwards
quarrelled with the Douglases, because his daughter was
passed over in favour of a daughter of Archibald, &ldquo;the Grim
Earl of Douglas,&rdquo; as wife for David, duke of Rothesay, son of
Robert III. When Douglas seized March&rsquo;s lands the latter fled
to England, where he was welcomed by Henry IV., to whom he
was related. He fought on the English side at Homildon Hill;
and, having revealed to Henry the defection of the Percies, who
were in league with Douglas and Owen Glendower, he fought
against those allies at the battle of Shrewsbury (July 23, 1403).
Becoming reconciled with Douglas, he returned to Scotland in
1409, and was restored to his earldom by the regent Albany.
He died in 1420.</p>

<p><span class="sc">George Dunbar</span>, 11th earl of Dunbar and 4th earl of March,
was one of the negotiators for the release of James I. of Scotland
in 1423 from his captivity in England, and was knighted at that
king&rsquo;s coronation. In 1434, however, on the ground that the
regent had had no power to reverse his father&rsquo;s forfeiture for
treason, March was imprisoned and his castle of Dunbar seized
by the king; and the parliament at Perth declared his lands and
titles forfeited to the crown. The earl, being released, retired to
England with his son Patrick, whose daughter and heiress
Margaret was ancestress of Patrick, 5th earl of Dumfries, now
represented by the marquess of Bute.</p>

<p>The earldom of March in the house of Dunbar having thus
been forfeited to the crown, James II. in 1455 conferred the title,
together with that of warden of the marches, on his second
son Alexander, duke of Albany; but this prince entered into
treasonable correspondence with Edward IV. of England, and in
1487 the earldom of March and the barony and castle of Dunbar
were again declared forfeited and annexed to the crown of
Scotland.</p>

<p>The title of earl of March was next held by the house of
Lennox. In 1576 the earldom of Lennox became extinct on the
death without male issue of Charles (father of Lady Arabella
Stuart), 5th earl of Lennox; and it was then revived in favour of
Robert Stuart, a grand-uncle of King James VI., second son of
John, 3rd earl of Lennox. But in 1579 Esmé Stuart, a member
of a collateral branch which in 1508 had inherited the lordship
of Aubigny in France, came to Scotland and obtained much
favour with James VI. The earldom of Lennox (soon afterwards
raised to a dukedom) was taken from Robert and conferred upon
Esmé; and Robert was compensated by being created earl of
March and baron of Dunbar (1582). Robert died without legitimate
issue in 1586, when the earldom of March again reverted
to the crown. In 1619 Esmé, 3rd duke of Lennox, was created
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page688" id="page688"></a>688</span>
earl of March; and his son James was created duke of Richmond
in 1641. On the death without issue of Charles, 6th duke of
Lennox and 3rd duke of Richmond, in 1672, his titles devolved
upon King Charles II. as nearest collateral heir-male. In 1675
Charles conferred the titles of duke of Richmond and Lennox
and earl of March on Charles Lennox, his natural son by Louise
de Keroualle, duchess of Portsmouth, from whom the earldom
of March has descended to its present holder the duke of
Richmond and Gordon. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Richmond, Earls and Dukes
of</a></span>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lennox</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The title of earl of March in the peerage of Scotland, by
another creation, was conferred in 1697 on William Douglas,
second son of William, 1st duke of Queensberry. His grandson
William, 3rd earl of March, became 4th duke of Queensberry on
the death without surviving male issue of his cousin Charles, 3rd
duke of Queensberry, in 1778. Dying unmarried in 1810, the
several titles of the duke passed to different branches of the house
of Douglas. The earldom of March is stated by Sir Bernard
Burke and other authorities to have devolved upon Francis,
8th earl of Wemyss, great-great-grandson of David, 3rd earl of
Wemyss, whose wife was Anne, daughter of the 1st duke of
Queensberry and sister of the 1st earl of March; and the title
is now assumed by the earl of Wemyss. On the other hand,
Francis, 8th earl of Wemyss, not having been an heir of the
body of the 1st earl of March, Sir Robert Douglas says in <i>The
Peerage of Scotland</i> that on the death of the 4th duke of
Queensberry in 1810 &ldquo;the earldom of March, it is supposed,
became extinct.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCH, AUZIAS<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1395-1458), Catalan poet, was born at
Valencia towards the end of the 14th century. Little is known
of his career except that he was twice married&mdash;first to Na
Ysabel Martorell, and second to Na Johanna Scorna&mdash;that he
died on the 4th of November 1458, and that he left several
natural children. Inheriting an easy fortune from his father,
the treasurer to the duke of Gandia, and enjoying the powerful
patronage of Prince Carlos de Viana of Aragon, March was
enabled to devote himself to poetical composition. He is an
undisguised follower of Petrarch, carrying the imitation to such
a point that he addresses his <i>Cants d&rsquo;amor</i> to a lady whom he
professes to have seen first in church on Good Friday; so far as
the difference of language allows, he reproduces the rhythmical
cadences of his model, and in the <i>Cants de mort</i> touches a note
of brooding sentiment peculiar to himself. Though his poems
are disfigured by obscurity and a monotonous morbidity, he
was fully entitled to the supremacy which he enjoyed among
his contemporaries, and the success of his innovation no
doubt encouraged Boscán to introduce the Italian metres into
Castilian.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His verses were first printed in Catalan in 1543, but they had
already become known through the Castilian translation published
by Baltasar de Romani in 1539.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCH, FRANCIS ANDREW<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (1825-&emsp;&emsp;), American philologist
and educationalist, was born on the 25th of October 1825
in Millbury, Massachusetts. He graduated in 1845 at Amherst,
where his attention was turned to the study of Anglo-Saxon by
Noah Webster. He was a teacher at Swanzey, New Hampshire,
and at the Leicester Academy, Massachusetts, in 1845-1847,
and attempted the philological method of teaching English &ldquo;like
Latin and Greek,&rdquo; later described in his <i>Method of Philological
Study of the English Language</i> (1865); at Amherst in 1847-1849;
at Fredericksburg, Virginia, in 1852-1855; and in 1855 became a
tutor at Lafayette College, where he became adjunct professor
of belles-lettres and English literature in 1856, and professor of
English language and comparative philology&mdash;the first chair of
the kind established&mdash;in 1857. He lectured on constitutional
and public law and Roman law in 1875-1877, and also taught
subjects as diverse as botany and political economy. In 1907
he became professor emeritus. At Lafayette he introduced the
first carefully scientific study of English in any American college,
and in 1870 published <i>A Comparative Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon
Language, in which its Forms are Illustrated by Those of
the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Gothic, Old Saxon, Old Friesic, Old
Norse and Old High German</i>, and <i>An Anglo-Saxon Reader</i>; he
was editor of the &ldquo;Douglass Series of Christian Greek and Latin
Classics,&rdquo; to which he contributed <i>Latin Hymns</i> (1874); he was
chairman of the Commission of the State of Pennsylvania on
Amended Orthography; and was consulting editor of the <i>Standard
Dictionary</i>, and in 1879-1882 was director of the American
readers for the Philological Society&rsquo;s (New Oxford) <i>Dictionary</i>.
He was president of the American Philological Association in
1873-1874 and in 1895-1896, of the Spelling Reform Association
after 1876, and of the Modern Language Association in
1891-1893. Among American linguistic scholars March ranks
with Whitney, Child and Gildersleeve; and his studies in English,
though practically pioneer work in America, are of undoubted
value. His article &ldquo;On Recent Discussions of Grimm&rsquo;s Law&rdquo;
in the <i>Transactions and Proceedings</i> of the American Philological
Association for 1873 in large part anticipated Verner&rsquo;s law.
With his son, Francis Andrew March, jun. (b. 1863), adjunct-professor
of modern languages in 1884-1891 and subsequently
professor of English literature at Lafayette, he edited <i>A

<p><span class="bold">MARCH,<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> the third month of the modern calendar, containing
thirty-one days. It was the Romans&rsquo; first month until the
adoption of the Julian calendar, 46 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and it continued to be
the beginning of the legal year in England until the 18th century.
In France it was reckoned the first month of the year until 1564,
when, by an edict of Charles IX., January was decreed to be
thenceforth the first month. Scotland followed the example
of France in 1599; but in England the change did not take place
before 1752. The Romans called the month <i>Martius</i>, a name
supposed to have been conferred on it by Romulus in honour
of his putative father, Mars, the god of war; but Ovid declares
the month to have existed before the time of Romulus, though
in a different position in the calendar. The Anglo-Saxons called
March <i>Hlyd-monath</i>, &ldquo;loud or stormy month,&rdquo; or <i>Lencten-monath</i>,
&ldquo;lengthening month,&rdquo; in allusion to the fact that the days then
rapidly become longer. There is an old saying, common to both
England and Scotland&mdash;which has its equivalent among the
Basques and many European peoples&mdash;representing March as
borrowing three days from April; the last three days of March
being called the &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; or the &ldquo;borrowed days.&rdquo; As
late as the end of the 18th century the first three days of March
were known in Devonshire as &ldquo;Blind Days,&rdquo; and were deemed
so unlucky that no farmer would sow seed then.</p>

<p>The chief festival days of March are the 1st, St David; the
12th, St Gregory; the 17th, St Patrick; and the 25th, Lady Day,
one of the quarter days in England.</p>

of a body of troops from one point to another, and the distance
covered in so doing. The word is also naturally applied to the
music composed for marching to, and to the steady regular
advance or progress of non-military bodies or persons, or of
events, &amp;c. In the military sense, &ldquo;marching&rdquo; is walking in
formed bodies of troops, either during drill evolutions on parade
or on the &ldquo;line of march&rdquo; from one place to another. In both
senses the word is used with mounted troops as well as with
dismounted men. Formerly all evolutions were carried out at
the so-called &ldquo;parade-march&rdquo; pace of about 75-80 paces to the
minute, and in one or two armies of the 18th century the parade
step cadence was as slow as 60. These cadences are now, however,
reserved in all armies for ceremonial occasions, and the
usual man&oelig;uvre and marching pace (&ldquo;quick march&rdquo;) is about
120, the &ldquo;double&rdquo; march pace (<i>pas gymnastique</i>) about 180.
The &ldquo;quick&rdquo; march, translated into miles and hours, is about
3<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> or 3<span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> miles an hour in all armies, though a few special bodies
of light troops such as the Italian <i>Bersaglieri</i> are trained to move
at a much faster rate for hours together, either by alternate
&ldquo;quick&rdquo; and &ldquo;double&rdquo; marching or by an unvarying &ldquo;jog-trot.&rdquo;
The paces recognized for cavalry are the walk, the trot,
the canter and the gallop; the usual practice on the line of march
being to alternate the walk and the trot, which combination
gives a speed of about 5 miles an hour for many hours together.
A &ldquo;day&rsquo;s march,&rdquo; or more simply a &ldquo;march,&rdquo; is usually reckoned
to be 15-16 miles for a large body of troops, a &ldquo;forced&rdquo; march
being one of 20 miles or over, or one in which, from whatever
cause, the troops are on foot for more than about seven hours.
For large bodies of troops the rate of movement on the line of
march rarely exceeds 3 miles an hour. The immense assistance
afforded by music to marching troops has been recognized from
the earliest times of organized armies, and a great deal of special
march-music has been written for military bands, formerly
often in <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> or <span class="spp">6</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> time (one bar representing one pace with the foot),
but now almost invariably in common or <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> time, which is more
suitable for the &ldquo;quick march.&rdquo; The music itself is usually a
combination of simple, lively melody and well-marked accents
for the drums, with little attempt at contrapuntal writing. The
fife or piccolo, the natural bugle (in Italy and elsewhere the chromatic
key-bugle is used), and the drum are the principal instruments,
the &ldquo;band,&rdquo; as distinct from the &ldquo;drums&rdquo; and &ldquo;bugles,&rdquo;
having in addition to drum and fifes clarinets (saxophones in
France and Belgium) and saxhorns of all types. In Scottish
regiments, and in a few isolated cases elsewhere, bagpipes provide
the marching music. The importance of music on the march
is attested further by the almost universal practice of singing or
whistling marching songs, and even playing them on concertinas,
&amp;c., in the absence of the band and drums.</p>

<p>2. From <i>marche</i>, the French form of a common Teutonic word
represented in English by &ldquo;mark&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>), a boundary or frontier
region between two countries or districts. The word appears to
have been first used in this sense in the 8th century, and the
earliest &ldquo;mark&rdquo; or &ldquo;march&rdquo; districts were tracts of land on
the borders of the Carolingian Empire. Wherever Charlemagne
pushed forward the frontiers of the Frankish realm he provided
for the security of his lands, new and old alike, by establishing
mark districts on the borders. The defence and oversight of these
were entrusted to special officers, afterwards called margraves,
or counts of the mark, who usually enjoyed more extensive
powers than fell to the lot of an ordinary count. It is at this
time that we hear first of the Spanish mark (<i>marca hispanica</i>)
and the Bavarian mark (<i>marca bajoariae</i>). These mark districts
were practically obliterated during the reigns of the feeble
sovereigns who succeeded Charlemagne, but the system was
revived with the accession of Henry the Fowler to the German
throne early in the 10th century and with a renewal of the work
of conquering and colonizing the regions east of the Elbe, and
in eastern Germany generally. Under Henry and his son, Otto
the Great, marks were again set upon the borders of Germany,
and this time the organization was more lasting. The mark
districts increased in size and strength, especially those which
fell under the dominion of an able and energetic ruler, and some
of them became powerful states, retaining the name mark long
after the original significance of the word had been forgotten. It
is interesting to note that the two most important of the modern
German states, Austria and Prussia, both had their origin in
mark districts, the mark of Brandenburg, the nucleus of the
kingdom of Prussia, being at first a border district to the east
of the duchy of Saxony, and the east mark, or mark of Austria,
being a border district of the duchy of Bavaria. In Italy march
districts made their appearance about the same time as in other
parts of the Frankish Empire. The best known of these is the
march of Ancona, which with other marches and adjoining
districts, was known later as the Marches, a province lying about
the centre of Italy between the Apennines and the Adriatic Sea.
After forming part of the states of the Church the Marches
were united with the kingdom of Italy in 1860 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Marches,
The</a></span>).</p>

<p>In England in the same connexion the plural word &ldquo;marches&rdquo;
was the form commonly adopted, and soon after the Norman
Conquest the disturbed districts on the borders of Wales began
to be known as the Welsh marches. Lands therein were granted
to powerful nobles on condition that they undertook the defence
of the neighbouring counties of England. These lords of the
marches, or lords marcher, as they were often called, had special
privileges, but they were generally so fully occupied in fighting
against each other and in seeking to increase their own wealth
and power that the original object of their appointment was
entirely forgotten. The condition of the marches grew worse and
worse, and during disturbed reigns, like those of Henry III. and
Edward II., lawlessness was rampant and rebellion was centred
therein. A more satisfactory condition of affairs, however,
prevailed after the conclusion of the Wars of the Roses; and the
establishment by Henry VIII. in 1542 of a council of Wales and
the marches was followed by a notable diminution of disorder in
this region. About the time of Elizabeth the Welsh marches
ceased to have any but an historical importance. In 1328
Roger Mortimer, a member of one of the most powerful of the
marcher families, was created earl of March (<i>comes de marchia
Waliae</i>), and in the reign of Edward III. (1354) the marches were
declared to be no part of the principality, but directly subject
to the English crown. It is difficult to define the boundaries
of the Welsh marches, as their extent varied considerably from
time to time, but under Edward I. and again under the Lancastrian
kings the marcher lordships included more than half of the area
of Wales; they embraced practically the whole of the principality
except the counties of Anglesea, Carnarvon and Merioneth in the
north and Carmarthen and Cardigan in the south, together with
parts of the English border counties, Monmouth, Hereford and
Shropshire.</p>

<p>The debateable ground between England and Scotland was
also known as the marches, although its condition began to
attract the attention of the southern kingdom somewhat later
than was the case with Wales. Arrangements were made for
garrisoning them and at one time they were divided into three
sections: the east, the west, and the middle marches, the oversight
of each being entrusted to a warden. Roughly speaking,
they embraced the modern counties of Northumberland and
Cumberland, together with a tract on the Scottish side of the
border. The need for protecting them ceased soon after the
accession of James VI. of Scotland to the English throne, and
they have now only an historical and legendary significance.
About 1200 Patrick de Dunbar, earl of Dunbar, called himself
earl of March, taking the name from the merse, or march, a
tract of land in Berwickshire.</p>

<p>In France under the <i>ancien régime</i> there was a county of La
Marche, and in north-east Germany there was the county of
La Marck, now part of the kingdom of Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCHE,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> or <span class="sc">La Marche</span>, one of the former provinces of
France. It owes its name to its position, it having been in the
10th century a march or border district between the duchy of
Aquitaine and the domains of the Frankish kings in central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page690" id="page690"></a>690</span>
France. Sometimes it was called the <i>Marche Limousine</i>, and
originally it was a small district cut partly from Limousin and
partly from Poitou. Its area was increased during the 13th
century, after which, however, it remained unaltered until the
time of the Revolution. It was bounded on the N. by Berry; on
the E. by Bourbonnais and Auvergne; on the S. by Limousin;
and on the W. by Poitou. It embraced the greater part of the
modern department of Creuse, a considerable part of Haute
Vienne, and a fragment of Indre. Its area was about 1900
sq. m.; its capital was Charroux and later Guéret, and among
its other principal towns were Dorat, Bellac and Confolens.</p>

<p>Marche first appears as a separate fief about the middle of the
10th century when William III., duke of Aquitaine, gave it to
one of his vassals named Boso, who took the title of count. In
the 12th century it passed to the counts of Limousin, and this
house retained it until the death of the childless Count Hugh in
1303, when it was seized by the French king, Philip IV. In 1316
it was made a duchy for Prince Charles, afterwards King Charles
IV., and a few years later (1327) it passed into the hands of the
family of Bourbon. The family of Armagnac held it from 1435
to 1477, when it reverted to the Bourbons, and in 1527 it was
seized by Francis I. and became part of the domains of the
French crown. It was divided into Haute Marche and Basse
Marche, the estates of the former being in existence until the 17th
century. From 1470 until the Revolution the province was
under the jurisdiction of the parlement of Paris.</p>

Pop. (1900), 12,468. Marchena occupies a sandy valley near
the river Corbones, a left-hand territory of the Guadalquivir.
Formerly it was surrounded with walls and towers, a large
portion of which still remains. Among the principal buildings
is the palace of the dukes of Arcos, within the enclosure of which
is an ancient Moorish building, now the church of Santa Maria
de la Mota. At the eastern end of the town is a sulphur spring.
There is some trade in wheat, barley, olives, oil and wine.
Marchena (perhaps the <i>Castra Gemina</i> of Pliny) was taken from
the Moors by St Ferdinand in 1240.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCHENA RUIZ DE CASTRO, JOSÉ<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> (1768-1821?), Spanish
author, was born at Utrera on the 18th of November 1768 and
studied with distinction at the university of Seville. He took
minor orders and was for some time professor at the seminary
of Vergara, but he became a convert to the doctrines of the
French <i>philosophes</i>, scandalizing his acquaintances by his professions
of materialism and his denunciations of celibacy. His
writings being brought before the Inquisition in 1792, Marchena
escaped to Paris, where he is said to have collaborated with
Marat in <i>L&rsquo;Ami du peuple</i>; at a later date he organized a revolutionary
movement at Bayonne, returned to Paris, avowed his
sympathies with the Girondists, and refused the advances of
Robespierre. He acted as editor of <i>L&rsquo;Ami des lois</i> and other
French journals till 1799, when he was expelled from France;
he succeeded, however, in obtaining employment under Moreau,
upon whose fall in 1804 he declared himself a Bonapartist. In
1808 he accompanied Murat to Spain as private secretary; in
this same year he was imprisoned by the Inquisition, but was
released by Joseph Bonaparte, who appointed him editor of the
official <i>Gaceta</i>. In 1813 Marchena retired to Valencia, and thence
to France, where he supported himself by translating into Spanish
the works of Montesquieu, Rousseau, Voltaire and Volney. The
Liberal triumph of 1820 opened Spain to him once more, but he
was coldly received by the revolutionary party. He died at
Madrid shortly before the 26th of February 1821. The interest
of his voluminous writings is almost wholly ephemeral, but they
are excellent specimens of trenchant journalism. His <i>Fragmentum
Petronii</i> (Basel, 1802), which purports to reconstruct
missing passages in the current text of Petronius, is a testimony
to Marchena&rsquo;s fine scholarship; but, by the irony of fate,
Marchena is best known by his ode to Christ Crucified, which
breathes a spirit of profound and tender piety.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCHES, THE<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span> (It. <i>Le Marche</i>), a territorial division of
Italy, embracing the provinces of Pesaro and Urbino, Ancona,
Macerata, and Ascoli Piceno, with an area of 3763 sq. m., and a
population of 1,088,763 in 1901. It is bounded by the Emilia on
the N., the Adriatic on the E., the Abruzzi on the S., and Umbria
and Tuscany on the W. The four provinces follow one another in
the order given from north to south and have a certain amount of
coast-line. The chief rivers, all of which run into the Adriatic eastwards
and north-eastwards, are the Metauro (anc. <i>Metaurus</i>, <i>q.v.</i>)
and the Tronto (anc. <i>Truentus</i>), the latter forming the southern
boundary of the <i>compartimento</i> for some distance. Except for
the river valleys and the often very narrow coast strip, the general
level is more than 500 ft. above the sea. The lower hills are very
largely composed of loose, clayey, unstable earth, while the
Apennines are of limestone. The province of Pesaro and Urbino
falls within the boundaries of the ancient Umbria (<i>q.v.</i>), while
the territory of the other three belonged to Picenum (<i>q.v.</i>).
The railway from Bologna to Brindisi runs along the coast-line
of the entire territory. At Ancona it is joined by the main line
from Foligno and Rome; at Porto Civitanova is a branch to
Macerata, San Severino and Fabriano (a station on the line from
Ancona to Rome and the junction for Urbino); at Porto S.
Giorgio is a branch to Fermo and, at Porto d&rsquo;Ascoli, a branch to
Ascoli Piceno. But, with the exception of the railway along the
coast, there is no communication north and south, owing to the
mountainous nature of the country, except by somewhat devious
roads.</p>

<p>Owing largely to the <i>mezzadria</i> or <i>métayer</i> system, under which
products are equally divided between the owners and the cultivators
of the land, the soil is fairly highly cultivated, though
naturally poor in quality. The silk industries, making of straw-plait
and straw hats, rearing of silkworms and cocoons, with
some sugar-refining, tobacco, terra-cotta manufacture, brickworks
and ironworks, furnish the chief occupations of the people
next after agriculture and pastoral pursuits. Another important
branch of activity is the paper industry, especially at Fabriano.
Chiaravalle possesses one of the largest tobacco factories of the
Italian <i>régie</i>. Limestone quarries and sulphur mines supply
building stone and sulphur to the regions of central Italy; chalk
and petroleum are also found. As regards maritime trade the province
possesses facilities in the port of Ancona (the only really
good harbour, where are also important shipbuilding works),
the canal ports of Senegallia (Sinigaglia), Pesaro, Fano and other
smaller harbours chiefly used by fishing boats. Fishing is
carried on by the entire coast population, which furnishes a
large contingent of sailors to the Italian navy.</p>

<p>For the early history of the territory of the Marches see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Picenum</a></span>. From the Carolingian period onwards the name Marca
begins to appear&mdash;first the Marca Fermana for the mountainous
part of Picenum, the Marca Camerinese for the district farther
north, including a part of Umbria, and the Marca Anconitana
for the former Pentapolis. In 1080 the Marca Anconitana was
given in investiture to Robert Guiscard by Gregory VII., to
whom the countess Matilda ceded the Marches of Camerino
and of Fermo. In 1105 we find the emperor Henry IV. investing
Werner with the whole territory of the three marches under
the name of March of Ancona. It was afterwards once more
recovered by the Church and governed by papal legates. It
became part of the kingdom of Italy in 1860.</p>

<p>The pictorial art of the Marches from the 13th century onwards
has become the object of considerable interest since the important
exhibition held at Macerata in 1905, when many interesting
works, scattered all over the district in small towns and villages,
were brought together. The result was something of a revelation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page691" id="page691"></a>691</span>
for, though the influence of Umbria was always considerable,
there were many independent elements (see F. M. Perkins in
<i>Rassegna d&rsquo; Arte</i>, 1906, 49 sqq.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCHMONT, EARLS OF.<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> The 1st earl of Marchmont was
Sir Patrick Hume or Home (1641-1724), son of Sir Patrick Hume,
bart. (d. 1648), of Polwarth, Berwickshire, and a descendant of
another Sir Patrick Hume, a supporter of the Reformation in
Scotland. A member of the same family was Alexander Hume
(<i>c.</i> 1560-1609), the Scottish poet, whose <i>Hymns and Sacred Songs</i>
were published in 1599 (new ed. 1832). Polwarth, as Patrick
Hume was usually called, became a member of the Scottish
parliament in 1665. Here he was active in opposing the harsh
policy of the earl of Lauderdale towards the Covenanters, and
for his contumacy he was imprisoned. After his release he went
to London, where he associated himself with the duke of
Monmouth. Suspected of complicity in the Rye House plot, he
remained for a time in hiding and then crossed over to the Netherlands,
where he took part in the deliberations of Monmouth,
the earl of Argyll and other exiles about the projected invasion
of Great Britain. Although he appeared to distrust Argyll,
Polwarth sailed to Scotland with him in 1685, and after the
failure of the rising he escaped to Utrecht, where he lived in great
poverty until 1688. He accompanied William of Orange to
England, and in 1689 he was again a member of the Scottish
parliament. In 1690 he was made a peer as Lord Polwarth; in
1696 he became lord high chancellor of Scotland, and in 1697
was created earl of Marchmont. When Anne became queen in
1702 he was deprived of the chancellorship. He died on the 2nd
of August 1724. His son Alexander, the 2nd earl (1676-1740),
took the name of Campbell instead of Hume after his marriage
in 1697 with Margaret, daughter and heiress of Sir George
Campbell of Cessnock, Ayrshire. He was a lord of session from
1704 to 1714; ambassador to Denmark from 1715 to 1721, and
lord clerk register from 1716 to 1733. His son Hugh Hume, 3rd
earl (1708-1794), who entered parliament in 1734 at the same
time as his twin brother Alexander (d. 1756), afterwards lord
clerk register of Scotland, was keeper of the great seal of Scotland,
one of Bolingbroke&rsquo;s most intimate friends and one of Pope&rsquo;s
executors. His two sons having predeceased their father, the
earldom became dormant, Marchmont House, Berwickshire, and
the estates passing to Sir Hugh Purves, bart., a descendant of
the 2nd earl, who took the name of Hume-Campbell. The 3rd
earl had, however, three daughters, one of whom, Diana
(d. 1827), married Walter Scott of Harden, Berwickshire; and in
1835 her son Hugh Hepburne-Scott (1758-1841) successfully
claimed the Scottish barony of Polwarth. In 1867 his grandson,
Walter Hugh (b. 1838), became 6th Lord Polwarth.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCHPANE,<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Marzipan</span>, a sweetmeat made of sweet
almonds and sugar pounded and worked into a paste, and moulded
into various shapes, or used in the icing of cakes, &amp;c. The best
marchpane comes from Germany, that from Königsberg being
celebrated. The origin of the word has been much discussed.
It is common in various forms in most European languages,
Romanic or Teutonic; Italian has <i>marzapane</i>, French <i>massepain</i>,
and German <i>marzipan</i>, which has in English to some extent
superseded the true English form &ldquo;marchpane.&rdquo; Italian seems
to have been the source from which the word passed into other
languages. In Johann Burchard&rsquo;s <i>Diarium curiae romanae</i>
(1483-1492) the Latin form appears as <i>martiapanis</i> (Du Cange,
<i>Glossarium s.v.</i>), and Minshseu explains the word as <i>Martius
Panis</i>, bread of Mars, from the &ldquo;towers, castles and such like&rdquo;
that appeared on elaborate works of the confectioner&rsquo;s art made
of this sweatmeat. Another derivation is that from Gr. <span class="grk" title="maza">&#956;&#940;&#950;&#945;</span>,
barley cake, and Lat. <i>panis</i>. A connexion has been sought
with the name of a Venetian coin, <i>matapanus</i> (Du Cange, <i>s.v.</i>),
on which was a figure of Christ enthroned, struck by Enrico
Dandolo, doge of Venice (1192-1205). From the coin the word
was applied to a small box, and hence apparently to the sweetmeat
contained in it.</p>

soldier. He subsequently served for nineteen years under
Ardaburius and Aspar, and took part in the wars against the
Persians and Vandals. Through the influence of these generals
he became a captain of the guards, and was later raised to the
rank of tribune and senator. On the death of Theodosius II.
he was chosen as consort by the latter&rsquo;s sister and successor,
Pulcheria, and called upon to govern an empire greatly humbled
and impoverished by the ravages of the Huns. Marcian repudiated
the payment of tribute to Attila; he reformed the finances,
checked extravagance, and repeopled the devastated districts.
He repelled attacks upon Syria and Egypt (452), and quelled
disturbances on the Armenian frontier (456). The other notable
event of his reign is the Council of Chalcedon (451), in which
Marcian endeavoured to mediate between the rival schools of

<p><span class="bold">MARCIANUS<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 400), Greek geographer, was born at
Heraclea in Pontus. Two of his works have been preserved in a
more or less mutilated condition. In the first, the <i>Periplus of the
Outer Sea</i>, in two books, in which he proposed to give a complete
description of the coasts of the eastern and western oceans, his
chief authority is Ptolemy; the distances from one point to
another are given in stades, with the object of rendering the work
easier for the ordinary student. In this he follows Protagoras,
who, according to Photius (cod. 188), wrote a sketch of geography
in six books. The work contains nothing that cannot be learned
from Ptolemy, whom he follows in calling the promontory of the
Novantae (<i>Mull of Galloway</i>) the most northern point of Britain.
Improving on Ptolemy, he makes the island of Taprobane
(<i>Ceylon</i>) twenty times as large as it is in reality. The second, the

of a similar work by Menippus of Pergamum, who lived during
the times of Augustus and Tiberius. It contains a description
of the southern coast of the Euxine from the Thracian Bosporus

<p><span class="bold">MARCION<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> and <span class="bold">THE MARCIONITE CHURCHES.</span> In the
period between 130 and 180 <span class="scs">A.D.</span> the varied and complicated Christian
fellowships in the Roman Empire crystallized into close and
mutually exclusive societies&mdash;churches with fixed constitutions
and creeds, schools with distinctive esoteric doctrines, associations
for worship with peculiar mysteries, and ascetic sects with
special rules of conduct. Of ecclesiastical organizations the most
important, next to Catholicism, was the Marcionite community.
Like the Catholic Church, this body professed to comprehend
everything belonging to Christianity. It admitted all believers
without distinction of age, sex, rank or culture. It was no mere
school for the learned, disclosed no mysteries for the privileged,
but sought to lay the foundation of the Christian community
on the pure gospel, the authentic institutes of Christ. The pure
gospel, however, Marcion found to be everywhere more or less
corrupted and mutilated in the Christian circles of his time. His
undertaking thus resolved itself into a reformation of Christendom.
This reformation was to deliver Christendom from false
Jewish doctrines by restoring the Pauline conception of the gospel,&mdash;Paul
being, according to Marcion, the only apostle who had
rightly understood the new message of salvation as delivered
by Christ. In Marcion&rsquo;s own view, therefore, the founding of
his church&mdash;to which he was first driven by opposition&mdash;amounts
to a reformation of Christendom through a return to the gospel
of Christ and to Paul; nothing was to be accepted beyond that.
This of itself shows that it is a mistake to reckon Marcion among
the Gnostics. A dualist he certainly was, but he was not a
Gnostic. For he ascribed salvation, not to &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; but to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page692" id="page692"></a>692</span>
&ldquo;faith&rdquo;; he appealed openly to the whole Christian world; and
he nowhere consciously added foreign elements to the revelation
given through Christ. It is true that in many features his
Christian system&mdash;if we may use the expression&mdash;resembles the
so-called Gnostic systems; but the first duty of the historian
is to point out what Marcion plainly aimed at; only in the second
place have we to inquire how far the result corresponded with
those purposes.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The doctrines of Marcion and the history of his churches from
the 2nd to the 7th century are known to us from the controversial
works of the Catholic fathers. From Justin onwards, almost every
eminent Church teacher takes some notice of Marcion, while very
many write extensive treatises against him. The most important
of those which have come down to us are the controversial pieces
of Irenaeus (in his great work against heretics), Tertullian (<i>Adv.
Marc.</i> i.-v.), Hippolytus, Pseudo-Origen Adamantius, Epiphanius,
and the Armenian Esnik.<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> From these works the contents of the
Marcionite Gospel, and also the text of Paul&rsquo;s epistles in Marcion&rsquo;s
recension, can be settled with tolerable accuracy. His opponents,
moreover, have preserved some expressions of his, with extracts
from his principal work; so that our knowledge of Marcion&rsquo;s views
is in part derived from the best sources.</p>
</div>

<p>Marcion was a wealthy shipowner, belonging to Sinope in
Pontus. He appears to have been a convert from Paganism to
Christianity, although it was asserted in later times that his
father had been a bishop. That report is probably as untrustworthy
as another, that he was excommunicated from the
Church for seducing a virgin. What we know for certain is that
after the death of Hyginus, bishop of Rome (or <i>c.</i> 139 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>), he
arrived, in the course of his travels, at Rome, and made a handsome
donation of money to the local church. Even then, however,
the leading features of his peculiar system must have been
already thought out. At Rome he tried to gain acceptance for
them in the college of presbyters and in the church; indeed he
had previously made similar attempts in Asia Minor. But he
now encountered such determined opposition from the majority
of the congregation that he found it necessary to withdraw from
the great church and establish in Rome a community of his own.
This was about the year 144. The new society increased in the
two following decades; and very soon numerous sister-churches
were flourishing in the east and west of the empire. Marcion
took up his residence permanently in Rome, but still undertook
journeys for the propagation of his opinions. In Rome he
became acquainted with the Syrian Gnostic Cerdo, whose speculations
influenced the development of the Marcionite theology.
Still Marcion seems never to have abandoned his design of gaining
over the whole Church to his gospel. The proof of this is
found, partly in the fact that he tried to establish relations
with Polycarp of Smyrna, from whom he got a sharp rebuff,
partly in a legend to the effect that towards the end of his life
he sought readmission to the Church. Such, presumably, was
the construction put in after times on his earnest endeavour to
unite Christians on the footing of the &ldquo;pure gospel.&rdquo; When he
died is not known, but his death can scarcely have been much
later than the year 165.</p>

<p>The distinctive teaching of Marcion originated in a comparison
of the Old Testament with the gospel of Christ and the theology
of the apostle Paul. Its motive was not cosmological or metaphysical,
but religious and historical. In the gospel he found
a God revealed who is goodness and love, and who desires faith
and love from men. This God he could not discover in the Old
Testament; on the contrary, he saw there the revelation of a
just, stern, jealous, wrathful and variable God, who requires
from his servants blind obedience, fear and outward righteousness.
Overpowered by the majesty and novelty of the Christian
message of salvation, too conscientious to rest satisfied with the
ordinary attempts at the solution of difficulties, while prevented
by the limitations of his time from reaching an historical insight
into the relation of Christianity to the Old Testament and to
Judaism, he believed that he expressed Paul&rsquo;s view by the
hypothesis of two Gods: the just God of the law (the God of the
Jews, who is also the Creator of the world), and the good God,
the Father of Jesus Christ. Paradoxes in the history of religion
and revelation which Paul draws out, and which Marcion&rsquo;s
contemporaries passed by as utterly incomprehensible, are here
made the foundation of an ethico-dualistic conception of history
and of religion. It may be said that in the 2nd century only one
Christian&mdash;Marcion&mdash;took the trouble to understand Paul; but
it must be added that he misunderstood him. The profound
reflections of the apostle on the radical antithesis of law and
gospel, works and faith, were not appreciated in the 2nd century.
Marcion alone perceived their decisive religious importance, and
with them confronted the legalizing, and in this sense judaizing,
tendencies of his Christian contemporaries. But the Pauline
ideas lost their truth under his treatment; for, when it is
denied that the God of redemption is at the same time the
almighty Lord of heaven and earth, the gospel is turned upside
down.</p>

<p>The assumption of two Gods necessarily led to cosmological
speculations. Under the influence of Cerdo, Marcion carried
out his ethical dualism in the sphere of cosmology; but the fact
that his system is not free from contradictions is the best proof
that all along religious knowledge, and not philosophical, had
the chief values in his eyes. The main outlines of his teaching
are as follows. Man is, in spirit, soul and body, a creature of the
just and wrathful god. This god created man from <span class="grk" title="ulê">&#8020;&#955;&#951;</span> (matter),<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
and imposed on him a strict law. Since no one could keep this
law, the whole human race fell under the curse, temporal and
eternal, of the Demiurge. Then a higher God, hitherto unknown,
and concealed even from the Demiurge, took pity on the wretched,
condemned race of men. He sent his Son (whom Marcion
probably regarded as a manifestation of the supreme God Himself)<a name="fa3e" id="fa3e" href="#ft3e"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
down to this earth in order to redeem men. Clothed in
a visionary body, in the likeness of a man of thirty years old,
the Son made his appearance in the fifteenth year of Tiberius,
and preached in the synagogue at Capernaum. But none of
the Jewish people understood him. Even the disciples whom
he chose did not recognize his true nature, but mistook him for
the Messiah promised by the Demiurge through the prophets,
who as warrior and king was to come and set up the Jewish
empire. The Demiurge himself did not suspect who the stranger
was; nevertheless he became angry with him, and, although
Jesus had punctually fulfilled his law, caused him to be nailed
to the cross. By that act, however, he pronounced his own
doom. For the risen Christ appeared before him in his glory,
and charged him with having acted contrary to his own law.
To make amends for this crime, the Demiurge had now to deliver
up to the good God the souls of those who were to be redeemed;
they are, as it were, purchased from him by the death of Christ.
Christ then proceeded to the underworld to deliver the spirits
of the departed. It was not the Old Testament saints, however,
but only sinners and malefactors like Cain, Esau and Saul, who
obeyed his summons. The prophets and patriarchs, having been
often deceived by the Demiurge, suspected a trick and would not
avail themselves of the promised salvation, remaining content
with the bliss of being in Abraham&rsquo;s bosom. Then, to gain the
living, Christ raised up Paul as his apostle. He alone understood
the gospel, and recognized the difference between the just
God and the good. Accordingly, he opposed the original apostles
with their Judaistic doctrines, and founded small congregations
of true Christians. But the preaching of the false Jewish
Christians gained the upper hand; nay, they even falsified the
evangelical oracles and the letters of Paul. Marcion himself
was the next raised up by the good God, to proclaim once more
the true gospel. This he did by setting aside the spurious
gospels, purging the real gospel (the Gospel of Luke) from supposed
judaizing interpolations, and restoring the true text of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page693" id="page693"></a>693</span>
the Pauline epistles.<a name="fa4e" id="fa4e" href="#ft4e"><span class="sp">4</span></a> He likewise composed a book, called the
<i>Antitheses</i>,<a name="fa5e" id="fa5e" href="#ft5e"><span class="sp">5</span></a> in which he proved the disparity of the two Gods,
from a comparison of the Old Testament with the evangelical
writings.</p>

<p>On the basis of these writings Marcion proclaimed the true
Christianity, and founded churches. He taught that all who
put their trust in the good God, and his crucified Son, renounce
their allegiance to the Demiurge, and approve themselves by
good works of love, shall be saved. But he taught further&mdash;and
here we trace the influence of the current gnosticism on Marcion&mdash;that
only the spirit of man is saved by the good God; the body,
because material, perishes. Accordingly his ethics also were
thoroughly dualistic. By the &ldquo;works of the Demiurge,&rdquo; which
the Christian is to flee, he meant the whole &ldquo;service of the
perishable.&rdquo; The Christian must shun everything sensual, and
especially marriage, and free himself from the body by strict
asceticism. The original ethical contrast of &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;just&rdquo;
is thus transformed into the cosmological contrast of &ldquo;spirit&rdquo;
and &ldquo;matter.&rdquo; The good God appears as the god of spirit, the
Old Testament God as the god of matter. That is Gnosticism;
but it is at the same time illogical. For, since, according to
Marcion, the spirit of man is derived, not from the good, but
from the just God, it is impossible to see why the spiritual should
yet be more closely related to the good God than the material.
There is yet another direction in which the system ends with a
contradiction. According to Marcion, the good God never
judges, but everywhere manifests His goodness&mdash;is, therefore,
not to be feared, but simply to be loved, as a father. But here
the question occurs, What becomes of the men who do not believe
the gospel? Marcion answers, The good God does not judge
them, but merely removes them from His presence. Then they
fall under the power of the Demiurge, who&mdash;rewards them for
their fidelity? No, says Marcion, but on the contrary&mdash;punishes
them in his hell! The contradiction here is palpable;
and at the same time the antithesis of &ldquo;just&rdquo; and &ldquo;good&rdquo;
ultimately vanishes. For the Demiurge now appears as an
inferior being, who in reality executes the purposes of the good
God. It is plain that dualism here terminates in the idea
of the sole supremacy of the good God.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that even in the 2nd century the
disciples of Marcion diverged in several directions. Rigorous
asceticism, the rejection of the Old Testament, and the recognition
of the &ldquo;new God&rdquo; remained common to all Marcionites,
who, moreover, like the Catholics, lived together in close communities
ruled by bishops and presbyters (although their constitution
was originally very loose, and sought to avoid every
appearance of &ldquo;legality&rdquo;). Some, however, accepted three
first principles (the evil, the just, the good); others held by two,
but regarded the Demiurge as the god of evil, <i>i.e.</i> the devil; while
a third party, like Apelles, the most distinguished of Marcion&rsquo;s
pupils, saw in the Demiurge only an apostate angel of the good
God&mdash;thus returning to monotheism. The golden age of the
Marcionite churches falls between the years 150 and 250. During
that time they were really dangerous to the great Church; for
in fact they maintained certain genuine Christian ideas, which
the Catholic Church had forgotten. The earliest inscription
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 318) on a Christian place of worship is Marcionite, and was
found on a stone which had stood over the doorway of a house
in a Syrian village. From the beginning of the 4th century they
began to die out in the West, or rather they fell a prey to Manichaeism.
In the East also many Marcionites went over to the
Manichaeans; but there they survived much longer. They can
be traced down to the 7th century, and then they seem to vanish.
But it was unquestionably from Marcionite impulses that the
new sects of the Paulicians and Bogomils arose; and in so far as
the western Cathari, and the antinomian and anticlerical sects
of the 13th century are connected with these, they also may be
included in the history of Marcionitism.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCOU, JULES<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (1824-1898), Swiss-American geologist,
was born at Salins, in the department of Jura, in France, on
the 20th of April 1824. He was educated at Besançon and
at the college of St Louis, Paris. He worked in early years with
J. Thurmann (1804-1855) on the geology of the Jura mountains.
In 1847 he went to North America as travelling geologist for the
<i>Jardin des Plantes</i>, and in the following year in Boston he joined
Agassiz, whom he had met in Switzerland, and accompanied
him to the Lake Superior region. Marcou spent two years in
studying the geology of various parts of the United States and
Canada, and returned to Europe for a short time in 1850. In
1853 he published a <i>Geological Map of the United States, and the
British Provinces of North America</i>. In 1855 he became professor
of geology and palaeontology at the polytechnic school
of Zurich, but relinquished this office in 1859, and in 1861 again
returned to the United States, when he assisted Agassiz in
founding the Museum of Comparative Zoology. In 1861 he
published his <i>Geological Map of the World</i> (2nd ed. 1875). Of
his published papers the more noteworthy are those on the Jura-Cretaceous
formations of the Jura, on the &ldquo;Dyas&rdquo; (Permian)
of Nebraska, and on the Taconic rocks of Vermont and Canada.
His other works include <i>Lettres sur les roches du Jura et leur

<p><span class="bold">MARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> (121-180), Roman emperor
and Stoic philosopher, was born in Rome <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 121, the date of his
birth being variously stated as the 6th, 21st and 26th of April.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page694" id="page694"></a>694</span>
His original name was Marcus Annius Verus.<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> His mother
Domitia Calvilla (or Lucilla) was a lady of consular rank, and
the family of his father Annius Verus (prefect of the city and
thrice consul), originally Spanish, had received patrician rank
from Vespasian. Marcus was three months old when his father
died, and was thereupon adopted by his grandfather. The
moral training which he received from his grandfather and his
mother must have been all but perfect. The noble qualities of
the child attracted the attention of Hadrian, who, playing upon
the name &ldquo;Verus,&rdquo; said that it should be changed to &ldquo;Verissimus&rdquo;
(BHPICCIMOC on medals). Hadrian adopted, as his
successor, Titus Antoninus Pius (uncle of Marcus), on condition
that he in turn adopted both Marcus (then seventeen) and Lucius
Ceionius Commodus, the son of Aelius Caesar, who had originally
been intended by Hadrian as his successor, but had died before
him. Marcus had been, at the age of fifteen, betrothed to Fabia,
the sister of Commodus; the engagement was broken off by
Antoninus Pius, and he was betrothed to Faustina, the daughter
of the latter. In 139 the title of Caesar was conferred upon him
and he dropped the name of Verus. The full name he then bore
was Marcus Aelius Aurelius Antoninus, Aelius coming from
Hadrian&rsquo;s family, and Aurelius being the original name of
Antoninus Pius. In 140 he was made consul.</p>

<p>The education of Aurelius in his youth was minute (see <i>Medit.</i>
i. 1-16). A better guardian than Antoninus Pius could not be
conceived. Marcus himself says, &ldquo;To the gods I am indebted
for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good
teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly
everything good.&rdquo; He was educated, not at school, but by
tutors, Herodes Atticus and M. Cornelius Fronto (<i>q.v.</i>) in the usual
curriculum of rhetoric and poetry; but at the age of eleven
he became acquainted with Diognetus the painter and Stoic
philosopher (<i>Hist. script. aug.</i> i. 305, notes), was fascinated by
the philosophy he taught, assumed the dress of his sect, and
ultimately abandoned rhetoric and poetry for philosophy and
law, having among his teachers of the one Sextus of Chaeronea,
grandson of Plutarch, and later Q. Junius Rusticus, and of the
other L. Volusius Maecianus (or Metianus), a distinguished jurist.
He went thoroughly into the practice as well as the theory of
Stoicism, and lived so abstemious and laborious a life that he
injured his health. From his Stoic teachers he learned to work
hard, to deny himself, to avoid listening to slander, to endure
misfortunes, never to deviate from his purpose, to be grave without
affectation, delicate in correcting others, &ldquo;not frequently
to say to any one, nor to write in a letter, that I have no leisure,&rdquo;
nor to excuse the neglect of duties by alleging urgent occupations.
Through all his Stoical training Aurelius preserved the
natural sweetness of his nature.</p>

<p>During the reign of Antoninus Pius (138 to 161), the concord
between him and Aurelius was complete; Capitolinus (<i>c</i>. 7) says
&ldquo;nec praeter duas noctes per tot annos mansit diversis vicibus.&rdquo;
The two were associated in the administration and in the simple
country occupations of the seaside villa of Lorium, the birthplace
of Pius, to which he loved to retire. It has been assumed
on the strength of a passage in Capitolinus that Aurelius married
Faustina in 146, but the passage is not clear, and other evidence
points strongly to 140; at all events it seems certain that a
daughter was born to him in 140. Antoninus Pius died in 161,
having recommended as his successor Aurelius, then forty years
of age, without mentioning Commodus, his other adopted son,
commonly called Lucius Verus. It is believed that the senate
urged Aurelius to take the sole administration. But he showed
the magnanimity of his nature by at once admitting Verus as
his partner, giving him the tribunician and proconsular powers,
and the titles Caesar and Augustus. This was the first time that
Rome had two emperors as colleagues. Verus, a weak, self-indulgent
man, had a high respect for his adoptive brother, and
deferred uniformly to his judgment. In the first year of his
reign Faustina gave birth to twins, one of whom became the
emperor Commodus.</p>

<p>The early part of the reign of Aurelius was clouded by national
misfortunes. An inundation of the Tiber swept away a large
part of Rome, destroying fields, drowning cattle, and causing a
famine (162); then came earthquakes, fires and plagues of insects;
the soldiers in Britain tried to induce their general Statius
Priscus to proclaim himself emperor; finally, the Parthians
under Vologaeses III. resumed hostilities, annihilated the Roman
forces under Severianus at Elegia in Cappadocia, and devastated
Syria. Verus, originally a man of considerable courage and
ability, was sent to oppose the Parthians, but gave himself up
to sensual excesses, and the Roman cause in Armenia would
have been lost, and the empire itself, perhaps, imperilled, had
not Verus had under him able generals,<a name="fa2f" id="fa2f" href="#ft2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a> the chief of whom was
Avidius Cassius (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cassius, Avidius</a></span>). By them the Parthian
War was brought to a conclusion in 165, but Verus and his army
brought back with them a terrible pestilence, which spread
through the whole empire. The people seem to have thought
that the last days of the empire had come. The Parthians had
at the best been beaten, not subdued; the Britons threatened
revolt; there were signs that various tribes beyond the Alps
intended to break into Italy. Indeed, the bulk of the reign of
Aurelius was spent in efforts to ward off the attacks of the
barbarians. He went himself to the wars with Verus in 167,
first to Aquileia and then on into Pannonia and Noricum,
wintering at Sirmium in Pannonia. Ultimately the Marcomanni,
the fiercest of the tribes that inhabited the country
between Illyria and the sources of the Danube, sued for peace
in 168. In January or February 160 Verus died at Altinum,
apparently of apoplexy, though some ventured to say that he
was poisoned by Aurelius.</p>

<p>Aurelius was thenceforth indisputed master of the empire,
during one of the most troubled periods of its history. His reign
is well described by F. W. Farrar (<i>Seekers after God</i>): &ldquo;He
regarded himself as being, in fact, the servant of all. The registry
of the citizens, the suppression of litigation, the elevation of
public morals, the care of minors, the retrenchment of public
expenses, the limitation of gladiatorial games and shows, the
care of roads, the restoration of senatorial privileges, the appointment
of none but worthy magistrates, even the regulation
of street traffic, these and numberless other duties so completely
absorbed his attention that, in spite of indifferent health, they
often kept him at severe labour from early morning till long after
midnight. His position, indeed, often necessitated his presence
at games and shows, but on these occasions he occupied himself
either in reading, in being read to, or in writing notes. He was
one of those who held that nothing should be done hastily, and
that few crimes were worse than the waste of time.&rdquo; The comprehensiveness
of his legal and judicial reforms is very striking.
Slaves, heirs, women and children, were benefited, and he made
serious attempts to deal with the steady fall in the birth-rate of
legitimate children.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 169 two of the German tribes, the Quadi and
the Marcomanni, with their allies the Vandals, Iazyges and
Sarmatians, renewed hostilities and, for three years, Aurelius
resided almost constantly at Carnuntum. In the end the
Marcomanni were driven out of Pannonia, and were almost
destroyed in their retreat across the Danube. In 174 Aurelius
gained over the Quadi a decisive victory, which is commemorated
by one of the sculptures on the column of Antonine. The story
is that the Romans, entangled in a defile, were suffering from
thirst. A sudden storm gave abundance of rain, while hail and
thunder confounded their enemies, and enabled the Romans
to gain an easy and complete victory. This triumph was
universally considered at the time, and for long afterwards, to
have been a miracle, and bore the title of &ldquo;The Miracle of the
Thundering Legion.&rdquo; The pagan writers (<i>e.g.</i> Dio Cassius,
lxx. 8-10) ascribed the victory to the magic arts of an Egyptian
named Arnuphis who prevailed on Mercury and other gods to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page695" id="page695"></a>695</span>
give relief, while the Christians attributed it to the prayers of
their brethren in a legion to which, they affirmed, the emperor
then gave the name of &ldquo;The Thundering.&rdquo; Dacier, however,
and others who adhere to the Christian view of the miracle,
admit that the appellation of &ldquo;Thundering&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lightning&rdquo;
(<span class="grk" title="keraunobolos">&#954;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#946;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, or <span class="grk" title="keraunophoros">&#954;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#965;&#957;&#959;&#966;&#972;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>) was given to the legion because
there was a figure of lightning on their shields. It has also
been virtually proved that it had the title even in the reign of
Augustus.</p>

<p>Aurelius next marched to Germany. There news reached
him that Avidius Cassius, the commander of the Roman troops
in Asia, had revolted and proclaimed himself emperor (175).
But after three months Cassius was assassinated, and his head
was brought to Aurelius, who with characteristic magnanimity,
persuaded the senate to pardon all the family of Cassius. It is
a proof of the wisdom of Aurelius&rsquo;s clemency that he had little
or no trouble in pacifying the provinces which had been the scene
of rebellion. He treated them all with forbearance, and it is
said that when the correspondence of Cassius was brought him
he burnt it without reading it. During his journey of pacification,
Faustina, who had borne him eleven children, died.
Dio Cassius and Capitolinus charge Faustina with the most
shameless infidelity to her husband, who is even blamed for
not paying heed to her crimes. But none of these stories
rests on trustworthy evidence; on the other hand, there can be
no doubt that Aurelius trusted her while she lived, and
mourned her loss.</p>

<p>After the death of Faustina and the pacification of Syria,
Aurelius proceeded, on his return to Italy, through Athens, and
was initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries, the reason assigned
for his doing so being that it was his custom to conform to the
established rites of the countries he visited. He gave large sums
of money for the endowment of chairs in philosophy and rhetoric,
with a view to making the schools the resort of students from
all parts of the empire. Along with his son Commodus he
entered Rome in 176, and obtained a triumph for victories in
Germany. In 177 occurred that persecution of Christians, the
share of Aurelius in which has been the subject of so much controversy.
Meanwhile the German War continued, and the two
Quintilii, who had been left in command, begged Aurelius once
more to take the field. In this campaign Aurelius, after a series
of successes, was attacked, according to some authorities, by an
infectious disease, of which he died after a seven days&rsquo; illness,
either in his camp at Sirmium (Mitrovitz), on the Save, in Lower
Pannonia, or at Vindobona (Vienna), on the 17th of March 180,
in the fifty-ninth year of his age. Other accounts are: (1) that
he was poisoned in the interests of Commodus (Dio. Cass. lxxi.
33, 4), (2) that he died of a chronic stomachic disease; the latter
is perhaps the most likely. His ashes (according to some
authorities, his body) were taken to Rome. By common consent
he was deified and all those who could afford the cost obtained
his statue or bust; for a long time his statues held a place among
the penates of the Romans. Commodus, who was with his father
when he died, erected to his memory the Antonine column (now
in the Piazza Colonna at Rome), round the shaft of which are
sculptures in relief commemorating the miracle of the Thundering
Legion and the various victories of Aurelius over the Quadi
and the Marcomanni. A bronze equestrian statue was set up
in the Forum, now on the Capitol.</p>

<p>Aurelius throughout his reign was hostile to Christianity. The
Christians suffered from systematic persecution, and many
historians, with a strange lack of historical insight, have poured
denunciation upon him for an attitude which was the natural
outcome of his convictions. During his reign the atmosphere
of Roman society was heavily charged with the popular Greek
philosophy to which, ethics apart, Christianity was diametrically
opposed. Under Antoninus the &ldquo;pursuit&rdquo; of Christians was
unknown; under Trajan and Hadrian it was forbidden (cf.
Keim, <i>Aus dem Urchrist</i>, p. 99). But Aurelius was an eager
patriot and a man of logical mind. From his earliest youth he
had learned to identify the ritual of the Roman religion with the
very essence of the imperial idea. He became a Salian priest
at the age of eight, and soon knew by heart all the forms and
liturgical order of the official worship, and even the sacred music.
In the earliest statue we have he is a youth offering incense; he
is a priest at the sacrificial altar in the latest triumphal reliefs.
Naturally he felt that the prevalence of Christianity was incompatible
with his ideal of Roman prosperity, and therefore
that the policy of the Flavian emperors was the only logical
solution of an important problem. Neumann argued that the
recrudescence of active persecution was initiated by a deliberate
ad hoc rescript issued probably in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 176. Sir W. M. Ramsay,
however, doubts this (<i>The Church in the Roman Empire</i>, London,
1893), and argues that it was due to a long series of instructions
to provincial governors (<i>mandata</i>, not <i>decreta</i>) who interpreted
their duty largely in conformity with the attitude of the reigning
emperor. In other words the governors were ordered merely
to punish sacrilege, and, under Aurelius, Christianity was regarded
as such. In the second place, though it is true that the
persecutions indicated by Celsus (Origen, <i>Celsus</i>, viii. 69), Justin,
Melito (in Eusebius, <i>H.E.</i>, iv. 26), Athenagoras (<i>Libellus pro
Christianis</i>) and the <i>Acts of Martyrs</i>, were greatly in excess of
those recorded in previous reigns, it must not be forgotten that
it was only in this period that the Christians began to keep
records. Thirdly, there can be no doubt that the Christians
had recently assumed a much bolder attitude, and thus segregated
themselves from the mass of those unorthodox sects which
the Roman could afford to despise. Like the Druids in Gaul
(cf. T. Mommsen, <i>Prov. Rom. Emp.</i>, Eng. trans. i. 105, and
V. Duruy, <i>Rev. archéol.</i>, Apr. 1880), the Christians were particularly
dangerous, inasmuch as they taught a unity which transcended
that of the Roman Empire, and must, therefore, have been
regarded as antagonistic to the existing political and social
organism.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we remember that Aurelius knew little of
the Christians, that the only mention of them in the <i>Meditations</i>
is a contemptuous reference to certain fanatics of their number
whom even Clement of Alexandria compares for their thirst for
martyrdom to the Indian gymnosophists, and finally that the
least worthy of them were doubtless the most prominent, we
cannot doubt that Aurelius was acting unquestionably in the
best interests of a perfectly intelligible ideal. He was &ldquo;Roman
in resolution and repression, Roman in civic nobility and pride,
Roman in tenacity of imperial aim, Roman in respect for law,
Roman in self-effacement for the service of the State&rdquo; (G. H.
Rendall).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Philosophy.</i>&mdash;The book which contains the philosophy of Aurelius
is known by the title of his <i>Reflections</i>, or <i>Meditations</i>, although
that is not the name which he gave to it himself (<span class="grk" title="Tà eis heauton">&#932;&#8048; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#972;&#957;</span>).
Of the genuineness of the work no doubts are now entertained.
It is believed that he wrote also an autobiography, which has perished.
The <i>Meditations</i> were written, it is evident, as occasion
offered&mdash;in the midst of public business, and on the eve of battles
on which the fate of the empire depended&mdash;hence their fragmentary
appearance, but hence also much of their practical value and even
of their charm. It is believed by many critics that they were
intended for the guidance of Aurelius&rsquo;s son, Commodus (<i>q.v.</i>);
at all events they are generally considered as one of the most precious
of the legacies of antiquity. Renan even called them &ldquo;the most
human of all books,&rdquo; and they are described by J. S. Mill in his
<i>Utility of Religion</i> as almost equal in ethical elevation to the Sermon
on the Mount.</p>

<p>Aurelius throughout his life adhered to the Stoical philosophy.
But, as Tenneman says, he imparted to it &ldquo;a character of gentleness
and benevolence, by making it subordinate to a love of mankind,
allied to religion.&rdquo; His thoughts represent a transitional movement,
and it is difficult to discover in them anything like a systematic
philosophy. From the manner, however, in which he seeks
to distinguish between matter and cause or reason, and from the
earnestness with which he advises men to examine all the impressions
on their minds, it may be inferred that he held the view of
Anaxagoras&mdash;that God and matter exist independently, but that
God governs matter. There can be no doubt that Aurelius believed
in a deity, although Schultz is probably right in maintaining that
all his theology amounts to this&mdash;the soul of man is most intimately
united to his body, and together they make one animal which we
call man; and so the deity is most intimately united to the world
or the material universe, and together they form one whole. We
find in the <i>Meditations</i> no speculations on the absolute nature of
the deity, and no clear expressions of opinion as to a future state.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page696" id="page696"></a>696</span>
We may also observe here that, like Epictetus, he is by no means
so decided on the subject of suicide as the older Stoics. Aurelius
is, above all things, a practical moralist. The goal in life to be
aimed at, according to him, is not happiness, but tranquillity, or
equanimity. This condition of mind can be obtained only by
&ldquo;living conformably to nature,&rdquo; that is to say, one&rsquo;s whole nature,
and as a means to that man must cultivate the four chief virtues,
each of which has its distinct sphere&mdash;wisdom, or the knowledge
of good and evil; justice, or the giving to every man his due;
fortitude, or the enduring of labour and pain; and temperance, or
moderation in all things. It is no &ldquo;fugitive and cloistered virtue&rdquo;
that Aurelius seeks to encourage; on the contrary, man must lead the
&ldquo;life of the social animal,&rdquo; must &ldquo;live as on a mountain&rdquo;; and
&ldquo;he is an abscess on the universe who withdraws and separates
himself from the reason of our common nature through being
displeased with the things which happen.&rdquo; While the prime
principle in man is the social, &ldquo;the next in order is not to yield to
the persuasions of the body, when they are not conformable to the
rational principle which must govern.&rdquo; This divinity &ldquo;within
a man,&rdquo; this &ldquo;legislating faculty,&rdquo; which, looked at from one
point of view, is conscience, and from another is reason, must be
implicitly obeyed. He who thus obeys it will attain tranquillity
of mind; nothing can irritate him, for everything is according to
nature, and death itself &ldquo;is such as generation is, a mystery of
nature, a composition out of the same elements, and a decomposition
into the same, and altogether not a thing of which any
man should be ashamed, for it is not contrary to the nature of
a reasonable animal, and not contrary to the reason of our
constitution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The morality of Marcus Aurelius cannot be said to have been
new when it was given to the world. Its charm lies in its exquisite
accent and its infinite tenderness. But above all, what gives the
sentences of Marcus Aurelius their enduring value and fascination,
and renders them superior to the utterances of Epictetus and Seneca,
is that they are the gospel of his life. His precepts are simply
the records of his practice. To the saintliness of the cloister he
added the wisdom of the man of the world; he was constant
in misfortune, not elated by prosperity, never &ldquo;carrying things
to the sweating-point,&rdquo; but preserving, in a time of universal
corruption, unreality and self-indulgence, a nature sweet, pure,
self-denying, unaffected.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARCY, WILLIAM LEARNED<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (1786-1857), American statesman,
was born in Southbridge (then part of Sturbridge), Massachusetts,
on the 12th of December 1786. He graduated at
Brown University in 1808, studied law, was admitted to the
bar in Troy, New York, and began practice there in 1810.
During the War of 1812 he served first as a lieutenant and afterwards
as a captain of volunteers, and on the 22nd of October
1812 took part in the storming of the British post at St Regis,
Canada. In 1816 he became recorder of Troy, but as he sided
with the Anti-Clinton faction of the Democratic-Republican
Party, known as the &ldquo;Bucktails,&rdquo; he was removed from office
in 1818 by his political opponents. As editor of the Troy <i>Budget</i>
(daily) he was a vigorous supporter of Martin Van Buren, and
when Van Buren&rsquo;s followers acquired control of the legislature
in 1821 Marcy was made adjutant-general of the New York
militia. From 1823 to 1829 Marcy was comptroller of the state,
an office then especially important on account of the large expenditures
for internal improvements, and during this period he
became the leading member of the famous &ldquo;Albany Regency,&rdquo;
a group of able Democratic politicians who exerted a powerful
influence throughout the state by their control of the party
patronage and machinery. He was one of the associate justices
of the New York Supreme Court from 1829 to 1831, presiding over
the trial of the alleged murderers of William Morgan and in other
important cases; and was a member of the United States Senate
from December 1831 to July 1832, when he resigned to become
governor of New York. In a speech in the Senate defending
Van Buren against an attack by Henry Clay, Marcy made the
unfortunate remark that &ldquo;to the victors belong the spoils of the
enemy,&rdquo; and thereby became widely known as a champion of
the proscription of political opponents. He served as governor
of New York for six years (Jan. 1, 1833 to Dec. 31, 1838), but
was defeated in 1838 by the Whig candidate, William H.
Seward. As governor he checked the issue of bank charters by
the legislature and secured the enactment, in 1838, of a general
banking law, which abolished the monopoly features incident
to the old banking system. In 1839-1842 Marcy was a member
of a commission appointed by President Van Buren, in accordance
with the treaty of 1839 between the United States and Mexico
to &ldquo;examine and decide upon&rdquo; certain claims of citizens of the
United States against Mexico. In 1843 he presided over the
Democratic state convention at Syracuse, and in 1844-1845 he
was recognized as one of the leaders of the &ldquo;Hunkers,&rdquo; or regular
Democrats in New York, and an active opponent of the &ldquo;Barnburners.&rdquo;
He was secretary of war under President Polk from
1845 to 1849, and as such, discharged with ability the especially
onerous duties incident to the conduct of the Mexican War;
he became involved, however, in controversies with Generals
Scott and Taylor, who accused him, it seems very unjustly, of
seeking to embarrass their operations in the field because they
were political opponents of the administration. In the Democratic
convention at Baltimore, in 1852, Marcy was a prominent
candidate for the presidential nomination, and from 1853 to
1857 he was secretary of state in the cabinet of President Pierce.
Few cabinet officers in time of peace have had more engrossing
duties. His circular of the 1st of June 1853 to American diplomatic
agents abroad, recommending that, whenever practicable,
they should &ldquo;appear in the simple dress of an American citizen,&rdquo;
created much discussion in Europe; in 1867 his recommendation
was enacted into a law of Congress. One of the most important
matters with which he was called upon to deal was the &ldquo;Koszta
Affair&rdquo;;<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> his &ldquo;Hülsemann letter&rdquo; (1853), is an important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page697" id="page697"></a>697</span>
state paper, and the principles it enunciates have been approved
by leading authorities on international law. In the same year
he secured the negotiation of the Gadsden Treaty (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gadsden,
James</a></span>), by which the boundary dispute between Mexico and
the United States was adjusted and a large area was added to
the Federal domain; and in June 1854 he concluded with Lord
Elgin, governor-general of Canada, acting for the British Government,
a treaty designed to settle the fisheries question and
providing for tariff reciprocity (as regards certain enumerated
commodities) between Canada and the United States. In 1854
Marcy had to deal with the complications growing out of the
bombardment of San Juan del Norte (Greytown), Nicaragua,
by the United States sloop-of-war &ldquo;Cyane&rdquo; for insults offered
the American minister by its inhabitants and for their refusal
to make restitution for damages to American property. The
expedition of William Walker (<i>q.v.</i>) to Nicaragua in 1855 further
complicated the Central American question. The Crimean War,
on account of the extensive recruiting therefor by British consuls
in several American cities, in violation of American neutrality,
led to a diplomatic controversy with Great Britain, and in May
1856 the British minister, John F. T. Crampton (1805-1886),
received his passports, and the exequaturs of the British consuls
at New York, Philadelphia and Cincinnati were revoked. The
incident created great excitement in England, but in 1857 the
British government sent Sir Francis Napier to Washington to
take Crampton&rsquo;s place. To the Declaration of Paris of 1856,
prescribing certain rules of naval warfare, Marcy on behalf of
his government refused to subscribe, because Great Britain had
rejected his proposed amendment exempting from seizure in time
of war all private property not contraband. The diplomatic
relations of the United States and Spain furnished, perhaps, the
most perplexing of Marcy&rsquo;s problems. Upon the seizure (on
Feb. 28, 1854) of the American vessel &ldquo;Black Warrior,&rdquo; the
confiscation of her cargo, and the fining of her captain by the
Cuban authorities, on the ground that this vessel had violated
the customs regulations of the port of Havana, slavery propagandists
sought to force the administration into an attitude that
would lead to war with Spain and make possible the seizure of
Cuba; and it was largely due to Marcy&rsquo;s influence that war was
averted, Spain restoring the confiscated cargo and remitting the
captain&rsquo;s fine.<a name="fa2g" id="fa2g" href="#ft2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The secretary, however, was not averse to
increasing his popularity and his chances for the presidency by
obtaining Cuba in an honourable manner, and it was at his
suggestion that James Buchanan, J. Y. Mason and Pierre
Soulé, the ministers respectively to Great Britain, France and
Spain, met at Ostend and Aix-la-Chapelle in October 1854 to
discuss the Cuban question. But the remarkable &ldquo;Ostend
Manifesto&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Buchanan, James</a></span>), the outcome of their conference,
was quite unexpected, and Marcy promptly disavowed
the document. Marcy died at Ballston Spa, New York, on the
4th of July 1857, a short time after the close of Pierce&rsquo;s administration.
In domestic affairs Marcy was a shrewd, but honest
partisan; in diplomacy he exhibited the qualities of a broad-minded,
patriotic statesman, endowed, however, with vigour,
rather than brilliancy, of intellect.</p>

arisen. Martin Koszta, a Hungarian revolutionist of 1848, had
emigrated to the United States and had there taken the preliminary
step for naturalization by formally declaring his intention to become
a citizen of the United States. In 1853 he went on personal business
to Smyrna, where he secured a passport from the American consul;
the Austrian consul, however, caused him to be seized and detained
on an Austrian brig-of-war. Soon afterward Captain Duncan N.
Ingraham (1802-1891), in command of a United States sloop-of-war,
arrived at Smyrna, and threatened to attack the Austrian vessel
unless Koszta were released; and as a compromise Koszta was
placed in the custody of the French consul. To Chevalier Hülsemann,
then representing Austria at Washington, who had demanded
from the United States the disavowal of the acts of its agents, the
complete surrender of Koszta, and &ldquo;satisfaction proportionate to
the magnitude of the outrage,&rdquo; Marcy wrote on the 26th of September
1853, that Koszta &ldquo;when seized and imprisoned was invested
with the nationality of the United States&rdquo; and had a right to the
protection of the United States government, and added: &ldquo;Whenever
by the law of nations an individual becomes clothed with our national
character&mdash;he can claim the protection of this government, and it
may respond to that claim without being obliged to explain its
conduct to any foreign power; for it is its duty to make its nationality
respected by other nations and respectable in every quarter of the
globe.&rdquo; Eventually Koszta was released and returned to the United
States. The Hülsemann letter was published and greatly increased
Marcy&rsquo;s popularity.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARDIN,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> the chief town of a sanjak of the Diarbekr vilayet
of Asiatic Turkey. It is a military station on the Diarbekr-Mosul
road. It occupies a remarkable site on the south side of a
conical hill of soft limestone, and the houses rise tier above tier.
The streets are narrow and paved in steps, while often the roadway
runs along the roof of the house in the tier below. The
hill is almost surrounded by old walls, while on the summit are
the remains of the famous castle of the Kaleh Shubha (Lat.
<i>Maride</i> or <i>Marde</i>,) which from Roman times has played an
important part in history. The Arab geographers considered it
impregnable, and from its steep approaches and well-arranged
defences it was able to offer a protracted resistance to the Mongolian
conqueror Hulagu and to the armies of Timur. It was
also for several centuries the residence of more or less independent
princes of the Ortokid Turkoman dynasty. The climate is
healthy and dry, and fruit grows well, but water is sometimes
scanty in the summer. Mardin is the centre of a good corn-growing
district, and is important chiefly as a border town for
the Kurds on the north and the Arab tribes to the south. It is
the chief centre of the Jacobite Christians, who have many
villages in the Tor Abdin hills to the north-east, and whose
patriarch lives at Deir Zaferan, a Syrian monastery of the 9th
century not far off in the same direction. The population is
estimated at 27,000, of whom about one-half are Christians of
the Armenian, Chaldean, Jacobite, Protestant and Roman
Catholic communities. Besides many mosques and churches
there are three monasteries (Syrian, Franciscan and Capuchin),
and an important American Mission station, with church,
schools and a medical officer.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARDUK<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> (Bibl. <span class="sc">Merodach</span><a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a>), the name of the patron deity
of the city of Babylon, who, when Babylon permanently became
the political centre of the united states of the Euphrates valley
under Khammurabi (<i>c.</i> 2250 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), rose to the position of the
head of the Babylonian pantheon. His original character
was that of a solar deity, and he personifies more specifically the
sun of the spring-time who conquers the storms of the winter
season. He was thus fitted to become the god who triumphs
over chaos that reigned in the beginning of time. This earlier
Marduk, however, was effaced by the reflex of the political
development through which the Euphrates valley passed and
which led to imbuing him with traits belonging to gods who at
an earlier period were recognized as the heads of the pantheon.
There are more particularly two gods&mdash;Ea and Bel&mdash;whose
powers and attributes pass over to Marduk. In the case of Ea
the transfer proceeds pacifically and without involving the effacement
of the older god. Marduk is viewed as the son of Ea.
The father voluntarily recognizes the superiority of the son and
hands over to him the control of humanity. This association
of Marduk and Ea, while indicating primarily the passing of the
supremacy once enjoyed by Eridu to Babylon as a religious and
political centre, may also reflect an early dependence of Babylon
upon Eridu, not necessarily of a political character but, in view
of the spread of culture in the Euphrates valley from the south
to the north, the recognition of Eridu as the older centre on the
part of the younger one. At all events, traces of a cult of Marduk
at Eridu are to be noted in the religious literature, and the most
reasonable explanation for the existence of a god Marduk in
Eridu is to assume that Babylon in this way paid its homage to
the old settlement at the head of the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>While the relationship between Ea (<i>q.v.</i>) and Marduk is thus
marked by harmony and an amicable abdication on the part of the
father in favour of his son, Marduk&rsquo;s absorption of the power and
prerogatives of Bel of Nippur was at the expense of the latter&rsquo;s
prestige. After the days of Khammurabi, the cult of Marduk
eclipses that of Bel (<i>q.v.</i>), and although during the five centuries
of Cassite control in Babylonia (<i>c.</i> 1750-1200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Nippur and
the cult of the older Bel enjoy a period of renaissance, when
the reaction ensued it marked the definite and permanent
triumph of Marduk over Bel until the end of the Babylonian
empire. The only serious rival to Marduk after 1200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> is
Assur (<i>q.v.</i>) in Assyria. In the south Marduk reigns supreme,
and his supremacy is indicated most significantly by making
him the <i>Bel</i>, &ldquo;the lord,&rdquo; <i>par excellence</i>.</p>

<p>The old myths in which Bel of Nippur was celebrated as the
hero were transformed by the priests of Babylon in the interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page698" id="page698"></a>698</span>
of the Marduk cult with the chief rôle assigned to their favourite.
The hymns once sung in the temple of Bel were re-edited and
adapted to the cult of Babylon. In this process the older Bel
was deliberately set aside, and the climax was reached when the
conquest of the monster Tiamat, symbolizing the chaos prevailing
in primeval days, was ascribed to Marduk instead of, as in the
older form of the epic, to Bel. With this stroke Marduk became
the creator of the world, including mankind&mdash;again setting aside
the far older claims of Bel to this distinction.</p>

<p>Besides absorbing the prerogatives of Ea and Bel, Marduk
was also imbued with the attributes of other of the great gods,
such as Adad, Shamash, Nergal and Ninib, so that, more
particularly as we approach the days of the Neo-Babylonian
Empire, the impression is created that Marduk was the only real
deity recognized, and that the other gods were merely the various
forms under which he manifested himself. So far as one can
speak of a monotheistic tendency in Babylonia it connects
itself with this conception that was gradually crystallized in
regard to the old solar deity of Babylon.</p>

<p>The history of the city of Babylon can now be traced back to
the days of Sargon of Agade (before 3000 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) who appears to
have given the city its name. There is every reason to assume,
therefore, that the cult of Marduk existed already at this early
period, though it must always be borne in mind that, until the
days of Khammurabi, his jurisdiction was limited to the city
of which he was the patron and that he was viewed solely as a
solar deity.</p>

<p>On monuments and cylinders he is represented as armed with
the weapon with which he despatched the monster Tiamat.
At times this monster is also depicted lying vanquished at his
feet, and occasionally the monster with the lance or the lance
alone is reproduced instead of the god himself.</p>

<p>In the astral-theological system, Marduk is identified with the
planet Jupiter. As the creator of the world, the New Year&rsquo;s
festival, known as Zagmuk and celebrated at the time of the
vernal equinox, was sacred to him. The festival, which lasted
for eleven days, symbolized the new birth of nature&mdash;a reproduction
therefore of the creation of the world. The arbiter of
all fates, Marduk, was pictured as holding an assembly of the
gods during the New Year&rsquo;s festival for the purpose of deciding
the lot of each individual for the year to come. The epic reciting
his wonderful deed in despatching the monster Tiamat and in
establishing law and order in the world in the place of chaos
was recited in his temple at Babylon known as E-Saggila,
&ldquo;the lofty house,&rdquo; and there are some reasons for believing
that the recital was accompanied by a dramatical representation
of the epic.</p>

<p>The meaning of the name Marduk is unknown. By a species
of word-play the name was interpreted as &ldquo;the son of the
chamber,&rdquo; with reference perhaps to the sacred chamber of fate
in which he sat in judgment on the New Year&rsquo;s festival. Ideographically
he is represented by two signs signifying &ldquo;child of
the day&rdquo; (or &ldquo;of the sun&rdquo;) which is a distinct allusion to his
original solar character. Other ideographic signs describe him
as the &ldquo;strong and universal ruler.&rdquo; The name of his consort
was Sarpanit, <i>i.e.</i> the shining or brilliant one&mdash;again an allusion
to Marduk&rsquo;s solar traits&mdash;and this name was playfully twisted
by the Babylonian priests to mean &ldquo;the seed-producing&rdquo; (as
though compounded of <i>z&#275;r</i>, seed, and <i>b&#257;nit</i>, producing),
which was regarded as an appropriate appellation for the female
counterpart of the creator of mankind and of life in general.
The punning etymology betrays the evident desire of the priests
to see in Marduk&rsquo;s consort a form or manifestation of the great
mother-goddess Ishtar (<i>q.v.</i>), just as in Assyria Ishtar frequently
appears as the consort of the chief god of Assyria, known as
Assur (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

and &ldquo;free sea&rdquo;), in international law, terms associated with the
historic controversy which arose out of demands on the part of
different states to assert exclusive dominion over areas of the
open or high sea. Thus Spain laid claim to exclusive dominion
over whole oceans, Great Britain to all her environing narrow
seas and so on. These claims gave rise to vigorous opposition
by other powers and led to the publication of Grotius&rsquo;s work
(1609) called <i>Mare liberum</i>. In <i>Mare clausum</i> (1635) John
Selden endeavoured to prove that the sea was practically as
capable of appropriation as territory. Owing to the conflict of
claims which grew out of the controversy, maritime states had
to moderate their demands and base their pretensions to maritime
dominion on the principle that it extended seawards
from land.</p>

<p>A formula was found by Bynkershoek in his <i>De dominio
maris</i> (1702) for the restriction of dominion over the sea to the
actual distance to which cannon range could protect it. This
became universally adopted and developed into the three-mile
belt (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Territorial Waters</a></span>). In recent times controversies
have arisen in connexion with the Baltic, the Black Sea and
more especially the Bering Sea. In the latter case the United
States, after the purchase of Alaska, vainly attempted to assert
dominion beyond the three-mile limit. Still more recently the
hardship of treating the greater part of Moray Firth as open sea
to the exclusion of British and to the advantage of foreign fishermen
has been raised (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">North Sea Fisheries Convention</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Territorial Waters</a></span>).</p>

<p>Conventions for the suppression of the slave trade, including
the Brussels General Act of 1885, and the North Sea Fisheries
Convention, have placed restrictions on the freedom of the high
sea, and possibly, in the general interest, other agreements will
bring it further under control, on the principle that what is the
property of all nations must be used without detriment to its
use by others (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">High Seas</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAREE, LOCH,<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> a fresh-water lake in the county of Ross and
Cromarty, Scotland. Its name&mdash;of which Maroy and Mourie
are older variants&mdash;does not, as is often supposed, commemorate
the Virgin, but St Maelrubha, who came from Bangor in Ireland
in 671 and founded a monastery at Applecross and a chapel (now
in ruins) on Isle Maree. Trending in a south-easterly to north-westerly
direction, the lake has a length of 13<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> m. from Kinlochewe
at the head of the dam erected in the 16th century (or earlier)
by the iron-smelters of the Cheardach Ruardh, or Red Smiddy,
on the short but impetuous river Ewe by which it drains to the
sea. It lies at a height of 32 ft. above sea-level; the greatest
breadth is just over 2 m. at Slattadale, the mean breadth being
<span class="spp">9</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span> of a mile; and the greatest depth, 367 ft., occurs in the upper
basin, the mean depth being 125 ft. Its waters cover an area
of fully 11 sq. m., and its islands nearly 1 sq. m., while the
drainage area is 171 sq. m. A remarkable feature is the large
number (more than 30) and considerable area of the islands.
Excepting Loch Cròcach, a small lake in the Assynt district of
Sutherlandshire, its insularity (<i>i.e.</i> the ratio of the total area of
the islands to that of the water surface) is higher than that of
any other lake in Great Britain, Loch Lomond coming next.
Nearly all the islands lie north and east of Slattadale, the largest
being Eilean Subhainn, or St Swithin&rsquo;s Isle, which contains a
small lake 750 ft. long, 300 ft. broad and 64 ft. deep. For two-thirds
of its length the loch is flanked by magnificent mountains.
On the north-east the principal heights are Ben Slioch (3217 ft.),
whose sugar-loaf form dominates the landscape, Ben Lair (2817)
and Ben Airidh-a-Char (2593), and, on the south-west, the peaks

populous and fertile coast plain, with considerable towns situated

passing through the district. But the decline of agriculture at
the end of the Republic led to a conversion of the land to pasture,
and later the unsettled state of affairs consequent on the fall
of the Roman Empire resulted in neglect of the watercourses.
Leopold II. of Tuscany (1822-1844) made the first successful
efforts to counteract the malaria which has affected the district,
by drainage, the filling up of swamps, and the establishment of

<p><span class="bold">MARENGO,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> a village of north Italy, on the road between

former. It is situated on the Fontanone brook, a small affluent
of the Tanaro which marks the western edge of the plain of
Marengo, the scene of the great victory won by Napoleon over
the Austrians under Baron Melas (1729-1806) on the 14th of
June 1800. (The antecedents of the battle are described under
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">French Revolutionary Wars</a></span>).</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:527px; height:368px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img699.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The French army, in ignorance of its opponent&rsquo;s position, had
advanced westward from the Scrivia towards Alessandria on the
12th, and its outposts had reached the Bormida on the evening
of the 13th. But contact with the main Austrian army was
not obtained, and on the assumption that it was moving towards
either Valenza or Genoa Napoleon weakened his army by considerable
detachments sent out right and left to find the enemy
and to delay his progress. Unknown, however, to Napoleon
Melas&rsquo;s army was still at Alessandria, and on the morning of
the 14th of June it filed out of the fortress and began its
advance into the great plain of Marengo, one of the few
favourable cavalry battle-grounds in north Italy.</p>

<p>The dispersion of the French army allowed only a fragmentary,
though most energetic, resistance to be offered to the Austrian
onset. The latter, considerably delayed at first by the crossing
of the river Bormida, broke up into two columns,<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> which advanced,
the right by the main road on Marengo, the left on Castel
Ceriolo. The former, personally commanded by Melas, was
20,000 strong, and General Victor, its immediate opponent,
about 10,000, or including some 5000 of Lannes&rsquo; corps who
fought on his right, about 15,000 strong; the Austrians were,
moreover, greatly superior in guns and cavalry. The French
disputed every yard of ground, holding their first line until they
had by fire and counter-attack forced practically the whole of
the Austrian right to deploy, and two hours passed before the
Austrians managed to reach the Fontanone brook. But Victor&rsquo;s
troops, being disorganized and short of ammunition, had then
to retire more rapidly across the plain. The retreat was orderly,
according to Victor&rsquo;s report, and made in échelon from the centre,
and it is certain that at any rate the regiments held together,
for the 6000 Austrian sabres found no opportunity to charge
home. Many guns and wagons were, however, abandoned.</p>

<p>On the French right, opposed to the column of Lieut.-Field-Marshal
Ott, was Lannes, with some 4000 men (excluding
Watrin&rsquo;s division which was with Victor) against 7500. He
too was after a time forced to retire, with heavy losses. Thus,
about 11 a.m. the First Consul, who was at some distance from
the field, was at last convinced that he had to deal with Melas&rsquo;s
army. At once he sent out his staff officers to bring back his
detachments, and pushed forward his only reserve, Monnier&rsquo;s
division, to support Lannes and Victor. But before this help
arrived Lannes had been driven out of Castel Ceriolo, and Victor
and Watrin forced back almost to San Giuliano. A little after
2 p.m. Monnier&rsquo;s division (3500) came into action, and its
impetuous advance drove the Austrians out of Castel Ceriolo.
But after an hour it was forced back in its turn, and by 3 p.m.
therefore, the 20,000 French troops, disordered and exhausted,
and in one line without reserves,<a name="fa2i" id="fa2i" href="#ft2i"><span class="sp">2</span></a> held a ragged line of battle
to the right and left of San Giuliano. The best that could be
expected was a prolongation of the struggle till nightfall and
a fairly orderly retreat. The Austrian general, believing that
the battle was won, returned to Alessandria, leaving a younger
man, his chief of staff Zach, to organize the pursuit.</p>

<p>Then followed one of the most dramatic events in military
history. Of the two detachments sent away by Napoleon in
search of the enemy, one only received its orders of recall.
This was Boudet&rsquo;s division of Desaix&rsquo;s corps, away to the south
at Rivalta and at noon heading for Pozzolo-Formigaro on the
Alessandria-Genoa road. At 1 p.m. a brief message, &ldquo;Revenez,
au nom de Díeu!&rdquo; altered the direction of the column, and
between 4 and 5, after a forced march, the division, headed by
Desaix, came on to the battle-field. It was deployed as a unit and
moved forward at the word of command along the main road
Alessandria-Tortona, the sight of their closed line giving fresh
courage to the men of Lannes and Victor. Then, while on the
other side Zach was arraying a deep column of troops to pursue
along the main road, Napoleon and Desaix, themselves under
fire, hastily framed a plan of attack. All arms were combined.
First, Marmont with eight of Boudet&rsquo;s guns and ten others (the
rest had been abandoned in the retirement) came into action
on the right of the road, replying to the fire of the Austrian
guns and checking their advanced infantry; close in rear of
the artillery was Desaix&rsquo;s infantry with the remnants of Lannes&rsquo;
and Victor&rsquo;s troops rallying on its right and left; on Lannes&rsquo;
right, still facing Ott&rsquo;s column, was Monnier, supported by
the Consular Guard of horse and foot; lastly 400 sabres of
Kellermann&rsquo;s cavalry brigade, which had already been engaged
several times and had lost heavily, formed up on the right of
Desaix. About 5 p.m. Desaix advanced against the head of the
Austrian main column formed by Zach. He himself fell in the
attack, but the onset of his intact troops drove back the leading
Austrians upon their supports, and at the critical moment when
the attack of Boudet&rsquo;s single weak division had almost spent its
force, Kellermann with his 400 sabres sallied out of the French
line. Marmont had brought up two guns to assist the infantry,
and as he fired his last round of case-shot the cavalry raced past
him to the front, wheeled inwards against the flank of the great
column, and rode through and through it. Zach was taken
prisoner with more than 2000 men, and Kellermann, rallying
some of his troopers, flung himself upon the astonished Austrian
cavalry and with the assistance of the Consular Guard cavalry
defeated it. The &ldquo;will to conquer&rdquo; spread along the whole
French line, while the surprise of the Austrians suddenly and
strangely became mere panic. Lannes, Victor and Monnier
advanced afresh, pushing the Austrians back on Marengo. A
few Austrian battalions made a gallant stand at that place,
while Melas himself, as night came on, rallied the fugitives
beyond. Next day the completely exhausted, but victorious,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page700" id="page700"></a>700</span>
French army extorted from the dazed Austrians a convention
by which all Italy up to the Mincio was evacuated by them.
The respective losses were: French about 4000, Austrians 9500.</p>

Haloragaceae). It grows on margins of lakes, ponds and
similar localities, and has a submerged stout creeping rootstock
from which spring many-jointed cylindrical stems bearing
numerous narrow leaves close-set in whorls. The minute
greenish flowers are borne in the leaf-axils. Like many fresh-water

<p><span class="bold">MARET, HUGUES-BERNARD,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> <span class="sc">Duc de Bassano</span> (1763-1839),
French statesman and publicist, was born at Dijon. After
receiving a sound education, he entered the legal profession
and became advocate at the King&rsquo;s Council at Paris. The
ideas of the French Revolution profoundly influenced him,
and wholly altered his career. The interest aroused by the
debates of the first National Assembly suggested to him the
idea of publishing them, conjointly with Méjean, in the <i>Bulletin
de l&rsquo;Assemblée</i>. The publicist Charles Joseph Panckoucke
(1736-1798), owner of the <i>Mercure de France</i> and publisher
of the famous <i>Encyclopédie</i> (1781), persuaded him to merge
this in a larger paper, the <i>Moniteur universel</i>, which gained a
wide repute for correctness and impartiality. He was a member
of the moderate club, the Feuillants; but after the overthrow
of the monarchy on the 10th of August 1792 he accepted an
office in the ministry of foreign affairs, where he sometimes
exercised a steadying influence. On the withdrawal of the
British legation from Paris Maret went on a mission to London,
where he had a favourable interview with Pitt on the 2nd of
December 1792. All hope of an accommodation was, however,
in vain. After the execution of Louis XVI. (Jan. 21, 1793),
the chief French diplomatic agent, Chauvelin, was ordered
to leave England, while the French Convention declared war
(Feb. 1, 1793). These events precluded the possibility of success
attending a second mission of Maret to London in January.
After a space, in which he held no diplomatic post, he became
ambassador of the French Republic at Naples; but, while
repairing thither with De Sémonville he was captured by
the Austrians and was kept in durance by them for some thirty
months, until, at the close of 1795, the two were set free in return
for the liberation of the daughter of Louis XVI. For a time
Maret betook himself to journalism; but he played a useful
part in the negotiations for a peace with Great Britain which
went on at Lille during the summer of 1797, until the victory
of the Jacobins at Paris in the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of Fructidor (Sept.
1797) frustrated the hopes of Pitt for peace and inflicted on
Maret another reverse of fortune. On the return of Bonaparte
from Egypt in 1799 Maret joined the general&rsquo;s party which came
to power with the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of Brumaire (Nov. 9-10, 1799).</p>

<p>Maret now became one of the First Consul&rsquo;s secretaries and
shortly afterwards secretary of state. In this position his
moderation, industry, good sense, knowledge of men and of
affairs, made his services of great value. The <i>Moniteur</i>, which
became the official journal of the state in 1800, was placed
under his control. He sometimes succeeded in toning down
the hard, abrupt language of Napoleon&rsquo;s communications,
and in every way proved a useful intermediary. It is known
that he had a share in the drawing up of the new constitutions
for the Batavian and Italian Republics. In 1804 he became
Minister; in 1807 he was named count, and in 1809 he received
the title of duc de Bassano, an honour which marked the sense
entertained by Napoleon of his strenuous toil, especially in
connexion with the diplomatic negotiations and treaties of
this period. His personal devotion to the emperor was of
that absolute unwavering kind which Napoleon highly valued;
it is seen in the attempt to defend the unworthy artifices adopted
by the great man in April-May 1808 in order to make himself
master of the destinies of Spain. Maret also assisted in drawing
up the constitution destined for Spain, which the Spaniards
at once rejected.</p>

<p>Maret accompanied Napoleon through most of his campaigns,
including that of 1809; and at its close he expressed himself in
favour of the marriage alliance with the archduchess Marie Louise
of Austria, which took place in 1810. In the spring of 1811, the
duc de Bassano replaced Champagny, duc de Cadore, as minister
of Foreign Affairs. In this capacity he showed his usual industry
and devotion, concluding the treaties between France and
Austria and France and Prussia, which preceded the French
invasion of Russia in 1812. He was with Napoleon through the
greater part of that campaign; and after its disastrous conclusion
helped to prepare the new forces with which Napoleon waged
the equally disastrous campaign of 1813. But in November
1813 Napoleon replaced him by Caulaincourt, duc de Vicence,
who was thought to be more devoted to the cause of peace
and personally grateful to the emperor Alexander I. of Russia.
Maret, however, as private secretary of the emperor, remained
with his master through the campaign of 1814, as also during
that of 1815. After the second restoration of the Bourbons
he was exiled, and retired to Grätz where he occupied himself
with literary work. In 1820 he was allowed to return to France,
and after the Revolution of 1830, Louis Philippe, king of the
French, made him a peer of France; he also held two high offices
for a few days. He died at Paris in 1839. He shares with
Daru the honour of being the hardest worker and most devoted
supporter in Napoleon&rsquo;s service; but it has generally been
considered that he carried devotion to the length of servility,
and thus often compromised the real interests of France. This
view has been contested by Baron Ernouf in his work <i>Maret,
duc de Bassano</i>, which is the best biography.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARET, ST<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Sancta Margarita</span>), virgin and martyr,
is celebrated by the Church of Rome on the 20th of July.
According to the legend, she was a native of Antioch, daughter
of a pagan priest named Aedesius. She was scorned by her father
for her Christian faith, and lived in the country with a foster
mother keeping sheep. Olybrius, the &ldquo;praeses orientis,&rdquo; offered
her marriage as the price of her renunciation of Christianity.
Her refusal led to her being cruelly tortured, and after
various miraculous incidents, she was put to death. Among the
Greeks she is known as Marina, and her festival is on the 17th
of July. She has been identified with St Pelagia (<i>q.v.</i>)&mdash;Marina
being the Latin equivalent of Pelagia&mdash;who, according to a
legend, was also called Margarito. We possess no historical
documents on St Margaret as distinct from St Pelagia. An
attempt has been made, but without success, to prove that the
group of legends with which that of St Margaret is connected
is derived from a transformation of the pagan divinity Aphrodite
into a Christian saint. The problem of her identity is a purely
literary question. The cult of St Margaret was very widespread
in England, where more than 250 churches are dedicated
to her.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARET, ST<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1045-1093), the queen of Malcolm III.
Canmore king of Scotland, was the daughter of the English
prince Edward, son of Edmund Ironside, and sister of Edgar
Ætheling, and was probably born in Hungary. In 1067 the
widow and children of Edward fled from Northumberland
with a large number of followers and sought the protection of
the Scottish king. The marriage of Malcolm and Margaret soon
took place and was followed by several invasions of Northumberland
by the Scottish king, probably in support of the
claims of his brother-in-law Edgar. These, however, had little
result beyond the devastation of the province. Far more
important were the effects of this alliance upon the history of
Scotland. A considerable portion of the old Northumbrian
kingdom had been reduced by the Scottish kings in the previous
century, but up to this time the English population had little
influence upon the ruling element of the kingdom. Malcolm&rsquo;s
marriage undoubtedly improved the condition of the English
to a great extent, and under Margaret&rsquo;s sons, Edgar, Alexander I.
and David I., the Scottish court practically became anglicized.
Margaret died on the 17th of November 1093, four days after
her husband and her eldest son Edward, who were slain in
an invasion of Northumberland. She rebuilt the monastery
of Iona, and was canonized in 1251 on account of her great
benefactions to the Church.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARET<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (1489-1541), queen of Scotland, eldest daughter
of Henry VII., king of England, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter
of Edward IV., was born at Westminster on the 29th of November
1489. Before she was six years old negotiations were opened,
which dragged on for several years, for marrying the princess
to James IV. of Scotland, whose support of the pretender
Perkin Warbeck it was hoped to avert by such an alliance.
Eventually the marriage was celebrated in Edinburgh on the
8th of August 1503. The avaricious Henry VII. gave his
daughter a scanty dowry and quarrels on this head embittered
the relations between the two kingdoms, which the marriage,
although accompanied by a treaty of perpetual peace, did
nothing to heal. The whole of Margaret&rsquo;s life after her marriage
with James IV. was an unending series of intrigues, first with
one political faction then with another; at one time in favour
of her native country, at another in hostility to it, her conduct
being mainly influenced at all times by considerations affecting
her pocket.</p>

<p>Margaret was crowned at Edinburgh in March 1504. Until
1507 she had no children; between that date and 1510 two
sons and a daughter were born, all of whom died in infancy;
in 1512 she gave birth to a son who succeeded his father as
James V.; in 1514 she bore a posthumous son, Alexander,
created duke of Ross, who died in the following year. A dispute
with her brother Henry VIII. over a legacy claimed by Margaret
was a contributory cause of the war which ended at Flodden,
where James IV. was killed on the 9th of September 1513, having
by his will appointed Margaret sole guardian of her infant son,
now King James V. Scotland was divided mainly into two
parties, one in favour of alliance with England, and the other
with France. The leader of the latter was John Stewart, duke
of Albany, next heir to the crown of Scotland after Margaret&rsquo;s
sons; Margaret herself for the most part inclined to the English
faction; and when Albany returned to Scotland from France
on the invitation of the Scottish parliament in the spring of
1514, the conflict grew almost to civil war. Various projects
for Margaret&rsquo;s remarriage had already been started, Louis XII.
of France and the emperor Maximilian being proposed as
suitable husbands for the young widow, when the queen privately
married Archibald Douglas, earl of Angus, on the 6th of August
1514. The consequences of this marriage were to alienate
many of the most powerful of the nobility, especially the earls
of Arran and Home, and to make Margaret entirely dependent on
the house of Douglas; while it furnished the council with a pretext
for removing her from the regency and guardianship of the
king in favour of Albany in July 1515. Albany had to blockade
Margaret in Stirling Castle before she would surrender her sons.
After being obliged to capitulate, Margaret returned to Edinburgh,
and being no longer responsible for the custody of the
king she fled to England in September, where a month later
she bore to Angus a daughter, Margaret, who afterwards became
countess of Lennox, mother of Lord Darnley and grandmother
of James I. of England.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1516 Margaret went to her brother&rsquo;s court
in London, while Angus, much to his wife&rsquo;s displeasure, returned
to Scotland, where he made his peace with Albany and was
restored to his estates. The rivalry between the French and
English factions in Scotland was complicated by private feuds
of the Hamiltons and Douglases, the respective heads of which
houses, Arran and Angus, were contending for the supreme
power in the absence of Albany in France, where at the instance
of Henry VIII. he was detained by Francis I. Margaret, quarrelling
with her husband over money matters, sided at first with
Arran and began to agitate for a divorce from Angus. In this
she was probably aided by Albany, who had been in Rome,
and who found an unexpected ally in the queen-mother, Margaret
being temporarily alienated from the English party by her
brother Henry&rsquo;s opposition to her divorce. When Albany
returned to Scotland in 1521 his association with Margaret gave
rise to the accusation that it was with the intention of marrying
her himself that he favoured her divorce from Angus, and it
was even suggested that she was Albany&rsquo;s mistress. As Albany
was strongly supported by the Scottish parliament, Angus
found it necessary to withdraw to France till 1524. During
these years there was constant warfare between the English
and the Scots on the border, but in May 1524 Albany was
obliged to retire to France. Henry VIII. continually aimed
at securing the person of his nephew, the king of Scots; while
Margaret veered from faction to faction without any settled
policy, unless it were the &ldquo;erection&rdquo; of her son, <i>i.e.</i> his
proclamation as a reigning sovereign, which she successfully
brought about in July 1524. The queen-mother had at this
time fallen in love with Henry Stewart, second son of Lord
Avondale, whom she married immediately after obtaining
her divorce from Angus in 1527. Margaret and her new
husband, who was created Lord Methven, now became for a
time the ruling influence in the counsels of James V. But
when her desire to arrange a meeting between James and Henry
VIII. in 1534 was frustrated by the opposition of the clergy
and the council, Margaret in her disappointment revealed certain
secrets to Henry which led to her being accused by her son
of betraying him for money and of acting as an English spy.
In 1537 she was anxious to obtain a divorce from Methven,
and her desire was on the point of being realized when it was
defeated by the intervention of James. Two years later she
was reconciled to her husband, by whom she had no children;
and, continuing to the end to intrigue both in Scotland and
England, she died at Methven Castle on the 18th of October
1541.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARET<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (1283-1290), titular queen of Scotland, and
generally known as the &ldquo;maid of Norway,&rdquo; was the daughter
of Eric II. king of Norway, and Margaret, daughter of Alexander
III. king of Scotland. Her mother died soon after Margaret&rsquo;s
birth, and in 1284 the estates of Scotland decided that if Alexander
died childless the crown should pass to his granddaughter.
In March 1286 Alexander was killed and Margaret became queen.
The English king Edward I. was closely watching affairs in
Scotland, and in 1289 a marriage was arranged between the
infant queen and Edward&rsquo;s son, afterwards Edward II. Margaret
sailed from Norway and reached the Orkneys, where she died
about the end of September 1290. The news of this occurrence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page702" id="page702"></a>702</span>
was first made known in a letter dated the 7th of October 1290.
Some mystery, however, surrounded her death, and about
1300 a woman from Leipzig declared she was Queen Margaret.
The impostor, if she were such, was burned as a witch at

<p><span class="bold">MARGARET<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (1353-1412), queen of Denmark, Norway and
Sweden, the daughter of Valdemar IV. of Denmark, was born
in 1353 and married ten years later to King Haakon VI. of
Norway. Her first act, after her father&rsquo;s death (1375), was to
procure the election of her infant son Olaf as king of Denmark.
Olaf died in 1387, having in 1380 also succeeded his father; and
in the following year Margaret, who had ruled both kingdoms
in his name, was chosen regent of Norway and Denmark. She
had already given proofs of her superior statesmanship by
recovering possession of Schleswig from the Holstein counts,
who had held it absolutely for a generation, and who now received
it back indeed as a fief (by the compact of Nyborg 1386), but
under such stringent conditions that the Danish crown got all
the advantage of the arrangement. By this compact, moreover,
the chronically rebellious Jutish nobility lost the support they
had hitherto always found in Schleswig-Holstein, and Margaret,
free from all fear of domestic sedition, could now give her
undivided attention to Sweden, where the mutinous nobles
were already in arms against their unpopular king, Albert of
Mecklenburg. At a conference held at Dalaborg Castle, in
March 1388, the Swedes were compelled to accept all Margaret&rsquo;s
conditions, elected her &ldquo;Sovereign Lady and Ruler,&rdquo; and engaged
to accept from her any king she chose to appoint. On the 24th
of February 1389, Albert, who had returned from Mecklenburg
with an army of mercenaries, was routed and taken prisoner
at Aasle near Falköping, and Margaret was now the omnipotent
mistress of three kingdoms. Stockholm then almost entirely
a German city, still held out; fear of Margaret induced both
the Mecklenburg princes and the Wendish towns to hasten
to its assistance; and the Baltic and the North Sea speedily
swarmed with the privateers of the <i>Viktualien brödre or Vitalianer</i>,
so called because their professed object was to revictual
Stockholm. Finally the Hansa intervened, and by the compact
of Lindholm (1395) Albert was released by Margaret on promising
to pay 60,000 marks within three years, the Hansa in the meantime
to hold Stockholm in pawn. Albert failing to pay his ransom
within the stipulated time, the Hansa surrendered Stockholm
to Margaret in September 1398, in exchange for very considerable
commercial privileges.</p>

<p>It had been understood that Margaret should, at the first
convenient opportunity, provide the three kingdoms with
a king who was to be her nearest kinsman, and in 1389 she
proclaimed her infant cousin, Eric of Pomerania, king of Norway.
In 1396 homage was rendered to him in Denmark and Sweden
likewise, Margaret reserving to herself the office of regent during
his minority. To weld the united kingdoms still more closely
together, Margaret summoned a congress of the three councils
of state to Kalmar in June 1397; and on Trinity Sunday, the 17th
of June, Eric was solemnly crowned king of Denmark, Norway
and Sweden. The proposed act of union divided the three
<i>Rigsraads</i>, but the actual deed embodying the terms of the
union never got beyond the stage of an unratified draft.
Margaret revolted at the clauses which insisted that each country
should retain exclusive possession of its own laws and customs,
and be administered by its own dignitaries, as tending in her
opinion to prevent the complete amalgamation of Scandinavia.
But with her usual prudence she avoided every appearance
of an open rupture.</p>

<p>A few years after the union of Kalmar, Eric, now in his
eighteenth year, was declared of age and homage was rendered
to him in all his three kingdoms, but during her lifetime Margaret
was the real ruler of Scandinavia. So long as the union was
insecure, Margaret had tolerated the presence near the throne
of &ldquo;good men&rdquo; from all three realms (the <i>Rigsraad</i>, or council of
state, as these councillors now began to be called); but their
influence was always insignificant. In every direction the
royal authority remained supreme. The offices of high constable
and earl marshal were left vacant; the <i>Danehoffer</i> or national assemblies
fell into desuetude, and the great queen, an ideal despot,
ruled through her court officials acting as superior clerks. But
law and order were well maintained; the licence of the nobility
was sternly repressed; the kingdoms of Sweden and Norway
were treated as integral parts of the Danish state, and national
aspirations were frowned upon or checked, though Norway,
as being more loyal, was treated more indulgently than Sweden.
Margaret also recovered for the Crown all the landed property
which had been alienated during the troublous days of
Valdemar IV. This so-called &ldquo;reduktion,&rdquo; or land-recovery,
was carried out with the utmost rigour, and hundreds of estates
fell into the Crown. Margaret also reformed the Danish currency,
substituting good silver coins for the old and worthless copper
tokens, to the great advantage both of herself and the state.
She had always large sums of money to dispose of, and a considerable
proportion of this treasure was dispensed in works of charity.
Margaret&rsquo;s foreign policy was sagaciously circumspect, in sharp
contrast with the venturesomeness of her father&rsquo;s. The most
tempting offer of alliance, the most favourable conjunctures,
could never move her from her system of neutrality. On the
other hand she spared no pains to recover lost Danish territory.
Gotland she purchased from its actual possessors, Albert of
Mecklenburg and the Livonian Order, and the greater part
of Schleswig was regained in the same way.</p>

<p>Margaret died suddenly on board her ship in Flensborg
harbour on the 28th of October 1412. We know very little
of her private character. Contemporary records are both
scanty and hostile to a sovereign who squeezed the utmost
out of the people. Craft and wiliness are the qualities most
generally attributed to her, coupled with the cynical praise
that &ldquo;in temporal matters she was very lucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARET OF ANJOU<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (1430-1482), queen of England,
daughter of René of Anjou, titular king of Naples and Jerusalem,
was born on the 23rd of March 1430. When just fourteen
she was betrothed to Henry VI. king of England, and in the
following year was brought to England and married at Titchfield
Abbey, near Southampton, on the 23rd of April 1445. On the
28th of May she was welcomed at London with a great pageant,
and two days later crowned at Westminster. Margaret&rsquo;s
marriage had been negotiated by William de la Pole, duke of
Suffolk, and when she came to England, Suffolk and his wife
were her only friends. Naturally she fell under Suffolk&rsquo;s
influence, and supported his policy. This, added to her French
origin and sympathies, made her from the start unpopular.
Though clever and good-looking, she was self-willed and imperious,
and without the conciliatory manners which her difficult position
required. In almost everything she was the opposite of her
gentle husband, but entered into his educational schemes,
and gave her patronage to the foundation of Queen&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge. Margaret&rsquo;s really active share in politics began
after Suffolk&rsquo;s fall in 1450. She not only supported Edmond
Beaufort, duke of Somerset, in his opposition to Richard of
York, but concerned herself also in the details of government,
seeking not over-wisely pecuniary benefits for herself and her
friends. But as a childless queen her influence was limited;
and when at last her only son, Edward, was born on the 13th
of October 1453, her husband was stricken with insanity. From
this time she was the ardent champion of her husband&rsquo;s and
son&rsquo;s rights; to her energy the cause of Lancaster owed its
endurance, but her implacable spirit contributed to its failure.
When York&rsquo;s protectorate was ended by Henry&rsquo;s recovery
in January 1455, Margaret, not content with the restoration
of Somerset and her other friends to liberty and office, pushed
her politics to extremes. The result was the defeat of the
Lancastrians at St Albans, and for a year Margaret had to

acquiesce in York&rsquo;s power. Yet at this time one wrote of her:
&ldquo;The queen is a great and strong laboured woman, for she
spareth no pain to sue her things to an intent and conclusion
to her power&rdquo; (<i>Paston Letters</i>, i. 378). All the while she was
organizing her party; and ultimately, in October 1456 at Coventry,
procured some change in the government. Though
formally reconciled to York in March 1458, she continued to
intrigue with her partisans in England, and even with friends
in France, like Pierre de Brezé, the seneschal of Normandy.
After the Yorkist failure at Ludlow in 1459, it was Margaret&rsquo;s
vindictiveness that embittered the struggle by a wholesale
proscription of her opponents in the parliament at Coventry.
She was not present with her husband at Northampton on the
10th of July 1460. After romantic adventures, in which she
owed her safety to the loyalty of a boy of fourteen, her only
companion, she escaped with her little son to Harlech. Thence
after a while she made her way to Scotland. From Mary of
Gelderland, the queen regent, she purchased the promise of
help at the price of surrendering Berwick. Margaret was still
in Scotland at the date of Wakefield, so was not, as alleged by
hostile writers, responsible for the barbarous treatment of York&rsquo;s
body. But she at once joined her friends, and was with the
northern army which defeated Warwick at St Albans on the
17th of February 1461; for the executions which followed she
must bear the blame. After Towton Margaret with her husband
and son once more took refuge in Scotland.</p>

<p>A year later she went to France, and with help from her father
and Louis XI. equipped an expedition under Pierre de Brezé.
She landed in Northumberland in October, and achieved some
slight success; but when on the way to seek further help from
Scotland the fleet was overwhelmed in a storm, and Margaret
herself barely escaped in an open boat to Berwick. In the
spring she was again trying to raid Northumberland, meeting
with many hardships and adventures. Once she owed her
escape from capture to the generosity of a Yorkist squire,
who carried her off on his own horse; finally she and her son
were brought to Bamburgh through the compassionate help
of a robber, whom they had encountered in the forest. Thence
in August 1463 she crossed to Sluys in Flanders. She was
almost destitute, but was courteously treated by Charles the
Bold, then count of Charolais, and so made her way to her
father in France. For seven years she lived at Saint-Michel-en-Barrois,
educating her son with the help of Sir John Fortescue,
who wrote at this time: &ldquo;We be all in great poverty, but yet
the queen sustaineth us in meat and drink. Her highness
may do no more than she doth&rdquo; (<i>Works</i>, ii. 72, ed. Clermont).
Margaret never lost her hopes of her son&rsquo;s restoration. But
when at last the quarrel between Warwick and Edward IV.
brought her the opportunity, it was with difficulty that she
could consent to be reconciled to so old and bitter an enemy.
After Warwick&rsquo;s success and Henry&rsquo;s restoration Margaret
still remained in France. When at last she was ready to sail
she was delayed by contrary winds. So it was only on the
very day of Warwick&rsquo;s defeat at Barnet (14th of April) that
Margaret and Edward landed at Weymouth. Three weeks
later the Lancastrians were defeated at Tewkesbury, and
Edward was killed. Margaret was not at the battle; she was
captured a few days after, and brought to London on the 21st
of May. For five years she remained a prisoner, but was treated
honourably and for part at least of the time was in charge
of her old friend the duchess of Suffolk. Finally Louis XI.
ransomed her under the Treaty of Pecquigny, and she returned
to France on the 29th of January 1476. Margaret
lived for six years at different places in Bar and Anjou, in
poverty and dependent for a pension on Louis, who made her
surrender in return her claims to her father&rsquo;s inheritance.
She died on the 25th of April 1482 and was buried at Angers
Cathedral. René, whom she probably never saw after 1470,
had died in the previous year. During her last years Chastellain
wrote for her consolation his <i>Temple de Bocace</i> dealing with
the misfortunes of contemporary princes.</p>

<p>As the courageous champion of the rights of her son and
her husband, Margaret must command a certain sympathy.
But she was politically unwise, and injured their cause by her
readiness to purchase foreign help at the price of English
interests. Comines wrote well of her that she would have done
more prudently if she had endeavoured to adjust the disputes of
the rival factions instead of saying &ldquo;I am of this party, and will
maintain it&rdquo; (<i>Mémoires</i> vi. ch. 13). Her fierce partisanship
embittered her enemies, and the Yorkists did not hesitate to
allege that her son was a bastard. This, like the scandal
concerning Margaret and Suffolk, is baseless; the tradition,
however, continued and found expression in the <i>Mirror for
Magistrates</i> and in Drayton&rsquo;s <i>Heroical Epistles</i>, as well as in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Henry VI</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARET OF AUSTRIA<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (1480-1530), duchess of Savoy
and regent of the Netherlands from 1507 to 1530, daughter
of the archduke Maximilian of Austria, afterwards the emperor
Maximilian I., was born at Brussels on the 10th of January
1480. At two years of age she was betrothed to the dauphin
Charles, son of Louis XI. of France, and was brought up at
the French court. In 1489, however, Charles, now king as
Charles VIII., to prevent Maximilian taking as his second wife
the duchess Anne of Brittany, threw over Margaret and married
the Breton heiress himself. Her ambitious father now sought
for Margaret another throne, and in April 1497 she was married
at Burgos to the Infant John, heir to the throne of Castile
and Aragon. She was left a widow, however, a few months later.
In 1501 Margaret became the wife of Philibert II., duke of
Savoy, who only survived until 1504. The sudden death of
her brother the archduke, Philip the Handsome (Sept 25,
1506), opened out to her a new career. In 1507 she was
appointed by her father regent of the Netherlands and guardian
of her nephew Charles, afterwards the emperor Charles V.
Charles came of age in 1515, but he entrusted Margaret with
the regency, as the vast extent of his dominions permitted
him but seldom to visit the Netherlands, and she continued
to hold the post until her death in 1530. She was a wise and
prudent ruler, of masculine temper and intrepidity, and very
capable in affairs.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARET OF AUSTRIA<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (1522-1586), duchess of Parma
and regent of the Netherlands from 1559 to 1567, was a natural
daughter of Charles V. Her mother, Margaret van Ghent, was
a Fleming. She was brought up by her aunts Margaret of
Austria and Maria of Hungary, who were successively regents
of the Netherlands from 1507 to 1530 and from 1530 to 1555.
In 1533 she was married to Alexander de&rsquo; Medici, duke of
Florence, who was assassinated in 1537, after which she became
the wife of Ottavio Farnese, duke of Parma, in 1542. The
union proved an unhappy one. Like her aunts, who had trained
her, she was a woman of masculine abilities, and Philip II.,
when he left the Netherlands in 1559 for Spain, acted wisely in
appointing her regent. In ordinary times she would probably
have proved as successful a ruler as her two predecessors in that
post, but her task was very different from theirs. She had to
face the rising storm of discontent against the Inquisition and
Spanish despotism, and Philip left her but nominal authority.
He was determined to pursue his own arbitrary course, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page704" id="page704"></a>704</span>
issue was the revolt of the Netherlands. In 1567 Margaret
resigned her post into the hands of the duke of Alva and
retired to Italy. She had the satisfaction of seeing her
son Alexander Farnese appointed to the office she had laid
down, and to watch his successful career as governor-general
of the Netherlands. She died at Ortona in 1586.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARET OF PROVENCE<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (1221-1295), queen of France,
was the daughter of Raymond Berenger V., count of Provence.
She was married to Saint Louis at Sens on the 27th of May
1234, and was crowned the next day. Blanche of Castile,
the queen-mother, arranged the marriage to win over to the
cause of France the powerful count of Provence, but treated
her daughter-in-law most unkindly, and her jealousy of the
energetic young queen was naturally shared by Louis, whose
coldness towards and suspicion of his wife are well known.
Margaret did not lack courage, she followed the king on his
crusade, and bore herself heroically at Damietta. But her
ambition and strong personal prejudices often led her to actions
injurious to the realm. This is most noticeable in her hostility
to her brother-in-law Charles of Anjou, who had married her
sister Beatrice, and her devotion to Henry III. of England,
who had married her other sister Eleanor. Aspiring during
the reign of her son to the same rôle which she had seen Blanche
of Castile play, she induced, in 1263, the young Philip, heir to
the throne, to promise to obey her in everything up to the age
of thirty; and Saint Louis was obliged to ask for a bull from
Urban IV. which would release the prince from his oath. After
Saint Louis&rsquo; death, Margaret continued obstinately to claim
her rights on the county of Provence against Charles of Anjou.
She sought to employ force of arms, calling upon her son,
her nephew Edward II. of England, and the German king
Rudolph of Habsburg. She did not give up her claim until
after the death of Charles of Anjou (1285), when Philip the
Bold succeeded in getting her to accept an income from the
county of Anjou in exchange for her rights in Provence. She
died on the 31st of December 1295.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARET MAULTASCH<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> (1318-1369), countess of Tirol,
who received the name of Maultasch (pocket-mouth) on
account of the shape of her mouth, was the daughter and heiress
of Henry, duke of Carinthia and count of Tirol. When Henry
died in 1335 Carinthia passed to Albert II., duke of Austria;
but Tirol was inherited by Margaret and her young husband, John
Henry, son of John, king of Bohemia, whom she had married in
1330. This union was not a happy one, and the Tirolese disliked
the government of Charles, afterwards the emperor Charles IV.,
who ruled the county for his brother. The result was that
John Henry was driven from Tirol, and Margaret&rsquo;s cause was
espoused by the emperor Louis IV., who was anxious to add
the county to his possessions. Declaring her marriage dissolved
on the ground that it had not been consummated, Louis
married Margaret in 1342 to his own son Louis, margrave of
Brandenburg. But as this action on the emperor&rsquo;s part entrenched
on the privileges of the Church, Pope Clement VI.
placed father and son under the ban, from which they were
not released until 1359. In 1361 Margaret&rsquo;s husband died,
followed two years later by her only son, Meinhard, when she
handed over Tirol to Rudolph IV., duke of Austria, and retired
to Vienna, where she died on the 3rd of October 1369. She
lived long in the memory of the people of Carinthia, who regarded
her as an amazon, and called her the <i>Wicked Gretl</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARINE,<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> the name, first given by Chevreul, to an
artificial substitute for butter, made from beef and other animal
fats, and sometimes mixed with real butter. The name of
&ldquo;butterine&rdquo; has also been used. Artificial butter, or &ldquo;margarine-mouries,&rdquo;
was for some years manufactured in Paris
according to a method made public by the eminent chemist
Mège-Mouries. Having surmised that the formation of butter
contained in milk was due to the absorption of fat contained
in the animal tissues, he was led to experiment on the splitting
up of animal fat. The process he ultimately adopted consisted
in heating finely minced beef suet with water, carbonate of
potash, and fresh sheep&rsquo;s stomach cut up into small fragments.
The mixture he raised to a temperature of 45° C. (113° F.).
The influence of the pepsine of the sheep&rsquo;s stomach with the
heat separated the fat from the cellular tissue; he removed
the fatty matter, and submitted it when cool to powerful
hydraulic pressure, separating it into stearin and oleomargarin,
which last alone he used for butter-making. Of this fat about
the proportions of 10 &#8468; with 4 pints of milk, and 3 pints
of water were placed in a churn, to which a small quantity
of anatto was added for colouring, and the whole churned
together. The compound so obtained when well washed was
in general appearance, taste and consistency like ordinary
butter, and when well freed from water it was found to keep
a longer time. Margarine is a perfectly wholesome butter-substitute,
and is now largely used, but the ease with which
it may be passed off as real butter has led to much discussion
and legislative action. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Adulteration</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGARITA,<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> an island in the Caribbean Sea belonging
to Venezuela, about 12 m. N. of the peninsula of Araya, and
constituting, under the constitution of 1904,&mdash;with Tortuga,
Cubagua and Coche&mdash;a political division called the Eastern
Federal District. The island is about 40 m. long from east
to west, has an area of 400 sq. m., and consists of two mountainous
extremities, nearly separated by the Laguna Grande
on the south, but connected by a low, narrow isthmus. The
highest elevation on the island is the peak of Macanao, 4484 ft.,
in the western part, the highest point in the eastern part
being the peak of Copei, 4170 ft. The higher valleys of the
interior are highly fertile and are well adapted to grazing and
stock-raising. The principal industries are fishing and the making
of salt. The pearl fisheries, which were so productive in the
16th and 17th centuries, are no longer important. A domestic
industry of the women is that of making coarse straw hats,
which are sold on the mainland. The products of Margarita,
however, are insufficient to support its population, and large
numbers periodically emigrate to the mainland, preventing
the increase in population which its healthful climate favours.
The population was estimated in 1904 at 40,000, composed
in great part of half-caste Guayqueri Indians. The capital
is Asunción (pop. about 3000), on the east side of the island,
and its principal port is Pompatar on the south coast. The
two small ports of Puebla de la Mar (<i>Porlamar</i>) and Puebla
del Norte are merely open roadsteads.</p>

<p>The island of Margarita (from Span. <i>Margarita</i>, pearl) was
discovered by Columbus in 1498, and was bestowed in 1524 upon
Marceto Villalobos by Charles V. In 1561 the freebooter
Lope de Aguirre ravaged the island, and in 1662 the town of
Pompatar was destroyed by the Dutch. For a long time
Margarita was attached to Cumana, but in the eighteenth
century it was made administratively independent. Its traders
and sailors rendered invaluable assistance to the revolutionists
in the war of independence, and the Spanish general, Morillo,
was driven from its shores in 1817; in recognition of this it was
made a separate state and was renamed Nueva Esparta (New
Sparta). In 1904-1909 it was a part of the Federal District
with Asunción as its capital. The first Spanish settlement
in South America was Nueva Cadiz, founded in 1515 on the
barren island of Cubagua; but the place was abandoned when
pearl-fishing and slave-trading ceased to be profitable.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGATE,<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> a municipal borough and seaside resort in the
Isle of Thanet parliamentary division of Kent, England, 74 m.
E. by S. of London by the South Eastern &amp; Chatham railway.
Pop. (1891), 18,662; (1901), 23,118. It lies on the north coast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page705" id="page705"></a>705</span>
of Thanet, and is practically contiguous with Westgate on
the west and with Broadstairs on the south-east, owing to the
modern extension of these popular watering-places. An electric
tramway connects Margate with Broadstairs and Ramsgate,
and during the season it is served by numerous pleasure
steamers from London. An esplanade faces the sea along
nearly the entire front of the town, and is lined with hotels,
shops and dwelling-houses. A jetty exceeding a quarter of
a mile in length permits the approach of vessels at all tides.
It was built in 1854 and subsequently enlarged, but a pier
was constructed by John Rennie in 1815, and is now chiefly
used by fishermen and colliers. The church of St John the
Baptist, founded in 1050, contains some portions of Norman
architecture, the remainder being Decorated and Perpendicular.
It is rich in ancient brasses and monuments, including a brass
to Sir John Daundelyon (1443), whose family occupied a manor
in the neighbourhood as early as the 13th century. The manor
house of Daundelyon, or Dent de Lion, with its gateway of
the early part of the 15th century, remains between Margate
and Westgate. Charitable institutions include a deaf and dumb
asylum (1875-1886), the Metropolitan infirmary for children
(1841), and the royal sea-bathing infirmary, established in 1791
and enlarged through the munificence of Sir Erasmus Wilson
in 1882. Dane Park (33 acres) was opened in 1898.</p>

<p>Margate (Meregate, Mergate), formerly a small fishing village,
was an ancient and senior non-corporate member of Dover.
In 1347 it contributed 15 ships of small tonnage at the time
of the siege of Calais. Throughout the 14th century references
are made to Margate in crown regulations regarding fisheries
and shipping. A pier existed before 1500, but by the reign
of Henry VIII. it was in a decayed condition. The amount of
corn shipped was evidently small, the droits being insufficient
to keep the pier in repair. Under Elizabeth Margate was
still an obscure fishing village employing about 20 small vessels
(&ldquo;hoys&rdquo;) in the coasting and river trades, chiefly in the conveyance
of grain, on which in 1791 it chiefly subsisted. The
droits increased, but were not properly collected until 1724.
In 1777 the pier was rebuilt. It was about this time that
Margate first began to be known as a bathing-place owing to
its fine stretch of firm sand. In 1835 Margate was still a liberty
of Dover and no right of citizenship could be acquired. In
1857 it was incorporated. In 1777 a weekly market was granted
on Wednesday and Saturday. It is now held daily, but principally
on those two days.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGGRAF, ANDREAS SIGISMUND<a name="ar85" id="ar85"></a></span> (1709-1782), German
chemist, was born at Berlin on the 3rd of March 1709. After
studying chemistry at Berlin and Strassburg, medicine at
Halle, and mineralogy and metallurgy at Freiberg, he returned
to his native city in 1735 as assistant to his father, Henning
Christian Marggraf, chief apothecary at the court. Three
years later he was elected to the Berlin Academy of Sciences,
which in 1754 put him in charge of its chemical laboratory
and in 1760 appointed him director of its physics class. He
died in Berlin on the 7th of August 1782. His name is especially
associated with the discovery of sugar in beetroot. In 1747
he published an account of experiments undertaken with the
definite view of obtaining true sugar from indigenous plants,
and found that for this purpose the first place is taken by
beetroot and carrot, that in those plants sugar like that of
cane exists ready formed, and that it may be extracted by
boiling the dried roots in alcohol, from which it is deposited
on cooling. This investigation is also memorable because he
detected the minute sugar-crystals in the roots by the help
of the microscope, which was thus introduced as an adjunct
to chemical inquiry. In another research dealing with the
nature of alum he showed that one of the constituents of that
substance, alumina, is contained in common clay, and further
that the salt cannot be prepared by the action of sulphuric
acid on alumina alone, the addition of an alkali being necessary.
He explained and simplified the process of obtaining phosphorus
from urine, and made some admirable observations
on phosphoric acid; but though he noted the increase in weight
that attends the conversion of phosphorus into phosphoric
acid he was content to remain an adherent of the phlogistic
doctrine. For his time he was a skilful chemical analyst;
he knew how to distinguish potash and soda by the different
colorations they produce in flame, and how to test for iron
with prussiate of potash: he was aware that sulphate of potash,
gypsum and heavy spar, in spite of their different appearances,
all contain sulphuric acid; and he recognized that there are
different varieties of urinary calculi. In metallurgy he devised
improved methods for the manufacture of zinc and the purification
of silver, tin and other metals.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGRAVE<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (Ger. <i>Markgraf</i>), a German title meaning
literally &ldquo;count of the March&rdquo; (Lat. <i>marchio</i>, <i>comes marchae</i>,
<i>marchisus</i>). The margraves had their origin in the counts
established by Charlemagne and his successors to guard the
frontier districts of the empire, and for centuries the title
was always associated with this function. The margraves
had within their own jurisdiction the authority of dukes, but
at the outset they were subordinate to the dukes in the feudal
army of the empire. In the 12th century, however, the margraves
of Brandenburg and Austria (the north and east marks)
asserted their position as tenants-in-chief of the empire; with
the break-up of the great duchies the others did the same;
and the margraves henceforward took rank with the great
German princes. The title of margrave very early lost its
original significance, and was borne by princes whose territories
were in no sense frontier districts, <i>e.g.</i> by Hermann, a
son of Hermann, margrave of Verona, who assumed in 1112
the title of margrave of Baden. Thus, too, when the elector
Albert Achilles of Brandenburg in 1473 gave Bayreuth and
Ansbach as apanages to his sons and their descendants these
styled themselves margraves. The title, however, retained
in Germany its sovereign significance, and has not, like &ldquo;marquis&rdquo;
in France and &ldquo;marchese&rdquo; in Italy, sunk into a mere
title of nobility; it is not, therefore, in its present sense the
equivalent of the English title &ldquo;marquess.&rdquo; The German margraviates
have now all been absorbed into other sovereignties,
and the title margrave is borne only as a subsidiary title in
the full style of their sovereigns.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGUERITE,<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> the popular name for the plant known
botanically as <i>Pyrethrum</i> (or <i>Chrysanthemum</i>) <i>frutescens</i> (natural
order Compositae), a shrubby perennial with smooth leaves
cut pinnately into narrow segments and flower-heads two to
three inches across produced singly in summer and autumn
on slender erect stalks. The white ray-florets surround a
yellow disk. It is a native of the Canary Isles, and a favourite
for decoration and for greenhouse cultivation, window-boxes
and open ground in the summer. The yellow marguerite
(<i>étoile d&rsquo;or</i>) has somewhat larger pale yellow flowers and
glaucous leaves. The plant is propagated from cuttings taken
in autumn from old plants and placed in sandy loamy soil in
cold frames. By pruning the shoots in autumn the plants may
be grown into very large specimens in the course of a few
seasons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGUERITE DE VALOIS.<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> The name Marguerite was
common in the Valois dynasty, and during the 16th century
there were three princesses, all of whom figure in the political
as well as in the literary history of the time, and who have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page706" id="page706"></a>706</span>
been not unfrequently confounded. The first and last are
the most important, but all deserve some account.</p>

<p>I. <span class="sc">Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoulême</span> (1492-1549). This, the most
celebrated of the Marguerites, bore no less than four surnames.
By family she was entitled to the name of Marguerite de Valois;
as the daughter of Charles d&rsquo;Orléans, count d&rsquo;Angoulême, she is
more properly, and by careful writers almost invariably, called
Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoulême. From her first husband she took,
during no small part of her life, the appellation Marguerite
d&rsquo;Alençon, and from her second, Henri d&rsquo;Albret, king of Navarre,
that of Marguerite de Navarre. She was born at Angoulême
on the 11th of April 1492, and was two years older than her
brother Francis I. She was betrothed early to Charles, duke
d&rsquo;Alençon, and married him in 1509. She was not very fortunate
in this first marriage, but her brother&rsquo;s accession to the
throne made her, next to their mother Louise of Savoy, the
most powerful woman of the kingdom. She became a widow
in 1525, and was sought in marriage by many persons of distinction,
including, it is said, Charles V. and Henry VIII. In
1527 she married Henri d&rsquo;Albret, titular king of Navarre,
who was considerably younger than herself, and whose character
was not faultless, but who seems on the whole, despite slander,
to have both loved and valued his wife. Navarre was not
reconquered for the couple as Francis had promised, but ample
apanages were assigned to Marguerite, and at Nérac and Pau
miniature courts were kept up, which yielded to none in Europe
in the intellectual brilliancy of their frequenters. Marguerite
was at once one of the chief patronesses of letters that France
possessed, and the chief refuge and defender of advocates
of the Reformed doctrines. Round her gathered C. Marot,
Bonaventure Des Périers, N. Denisot, J. Peletier, V. Brodeau,
and many other men of letters, while she protected Rabelais,
E. Dolet, &amp;c. For a time her influence with her brother, to whom
she was entirely devoted, and whom she visited when he was
imprisoned in Spain, was effectual, but latterly political rather
than religious considerations made him discourage Lutheranism,
and a fierce persecution was begun against both Protestants
and freethinkers, a persecution which drove Des Périers
to suicide and brought Dolet to the stake. Marguerite herself,
however, was protected by her brother, and her personal inclinations
seem to have been rather towards a mystical pietism than
towards dogmatic Protestant sentiments. Nevertheless bigotry
and the desire to tarnish the reputation of women of letters
have led to the bringing of odious accusations against her
character, for which there is not the smallest foundation.
Marguerite died at Odot-en-Bigorre on the 21st of September
1549. By her first husband she had no children, by her second
a son who died in infancy, and a daughter, Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret,
who became the mother of Henry IV. Although the poets
of the time are unwearied in celebrating her charms, she does
not, from the portraits which exist, appear to have been regularly
beautiful, but as to her sweetness of disposition and
strength of mind there is universal consent.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Her literary work consists of the <i>Heptameron</i>, of poems entitled
<i>Les Marguerites de la marguerite des princesses</i>, and of <i>Letters</i>. The
<i>Heptameron</i>, constructed, as its name indicates, on the lines of the
<i>Decameron</i> of Boccaccio, consists of seventy-two short stories told
to each other by a company of ladies and gentlemen who are stopped
in the journey homewards from Cauterets by the swelling of a river.
It was not printed till 1558, ten years after the author&rsquo;s death, and
then under the title of <i>Les Amants fortunés</i>. Internal evidence is
strongly in favour of its having been a joint work, in which more
than one of the men of letters who composed Marguerite&rsquo;s household
took part. It is a delightful book, and strongly characteristic of
the French Renaissance. The sensuality which characterized the
period appears in it, but in a less coarse form than in the great work
of Rabelais; and there is a poetical spirit which, except in rare
instances, is absent from <i>Pantagruel</i>. The <i>Letters</i> are interesting
and good. The <i>Marguerites</i> consist of a very miscellaneous collection
of poems, mysteries, farces, devotional poems of considerable
length, spiritual and miscellaneous songs, &amp;c. The <i>Dernières
poésies</i>, not printed till 1896 (by M. A. Lefranc), are interesting and
characteristic, consisting of verse-epistles, <i>comédies</i> (pieces in
dramatic form on the death of Francis I., &amp;c.), <i>Les Prisons</i>, a long
allegorical poem of amorous-religious-historical tenor; some miscellaneous
verse chiefly in dizains, and a later and remarkable
piece, <i>Le Navire</i>, expressing her despair at her brother&rsquo;s death.
Of the other works, never yet completely edited, the best editions
are, for the <i>Heptameron</i>, Leroux de Lincy (1855); for the <i>Lettres</i>,
Genin (1841-1842); and for the <i>Marguerites</i>, &amp;c., Frank (1873).
English translations of the <i>Heptameron</i> are rather numerous: one
appeared in 1887 by A. Machen, with an introduction by Miss
A. M. F. Robinson (Mme Darmesteter) and another (anonymous)
in 1894, with an essay by G. Saintsbury. The religious poem,
<i>Le Miroir de l&rsquo;âme pécheresse</i> was translated by Queen Elizabeth.
Books on Marguerite and her court are also many. There may be
noted Durand&rsquo;s <i>Marguerite de Valois et la cour de François I<span class="sp">er</span></i>
(1848); La Ferrière&rsquo;s <i>Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoulême</i> (1891); Lotheissen&rsquo;s
<i>Königin Margareta von Navarra</i> (1885); Miss Edith Sichel&rsquo;s <i>Women
and Men of the French Renaissance</i> (1901), and P. Courtault&rsquo;s
<i>Marguerite de Navarre</i> (1904).</p>
</div>

<p>II. The second <span class="sc">Marguerite</span> (1523-1574), daughter of Francis
I., was born on the 5th of June, 1523, at St Germain-en-Laye,
and, at an age the lateness of which caused lampoons, married
Emmanuel Philibert, duke of Savoy, in 1559. Like her aunt
and her niece she was a good scholar and strongly interested in
men of letters. She is noteworthy as having given the chief
impulse at the court of her brother Henry II. to the first efforts
of the Pléiade (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ronsard</a></span>), and as having continued her
patronage of literature at Turin. The poet Marc Antonio
Flaminio, for instance, congratulates himself in pretty Latin
verses on her singing his poems.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Her <i>Letters</i> have been published by A. G. Spinelli.</p>
</div>

<p>III. The third <span class="sc">Marguerite</span> (1553-1615), called more particularly
Marguerite de Valois, was great-niece of the first and
niece of the second, being daughter of Henry II. by Catherine de&rsquo;
Medici. She was born on the 14th of May 1553. When very
young she became famous for her beauty, her learning, and the
looseness of her conduct. She was married, after a liaison with
the duke of Guise, to Henry of Navarre, afterwards Henry IV.,
on the eve of St Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day. Both husband and wife
were extreme examples of the licentious manners of the time,
but they not unfrequently lived together for considerable periods,
and nearly always on good terms. Later, however, Marguerite
was established in the castle of Usson in Auvergne, and after the
accession of Henry the marriage was dissolved by the pope. But
Henry and Marguerite still continued friends; she still bore the
title of queen; she visited Marie de&rsquo; Medici on equal terms; and
the king frequently consulted her on important affairs, though
his somewhat parsimonious spirit was grieved by her extravagance.
Marguerite exhibited during the rest of her life, which
was not a short one, the strange Valois mixture of licentiousness,
pious exercises, and the cultivation of art and letters, and died
in Paris on the 27th of March 1615. She left letters and memoirs
the latter of which are admirably written, and rank among the
best of the 16th century. She was the idol of Pierre de Bourdeille
Brantôme, and is the &ldquo;Reine Margot&rdquo; of anecdotic history and
romance.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Mémoires</i> are contained in the collection of Michaud and
Poujoulat, and have been published separately by Guessard (the
best, 1842), Lalanne, Caboche, &amp;c. An English translation with
introduction by Violet Fane appeared in 1892. Her character,
and still more her circumstances, made the pen very unamiably
busy with her in her lifetime, the chief of many lampoons being
the famous <i>Divorce satirique</i>, variously attributed to Agrippa
d&rsquo;Aubigné, Palma Cayet, and others. The chief recent book on
her is Saint Poucy&rsquo;s <i>Histoire de Marguerite de Valois</i> (1887).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARGUERITTE, PAUL<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> (1860-&emsp;&emsp;) and <span class="bold">VICTOR</span> (1866-&emsp;&emsp;),
French novelists, both born in Algeria, were the sons of General
Jean Auguste Marguerite (1823-1870), who after an honourable
career in Algeria was mortally wounded in the great cavalry
charge at Sedan, and died in Belgium, on the 6th of September
1870. An account of his life was published by Paul Marguerite
as <i>Mon père</i> (1884; enlarged ed., 1897). The names of the
two brothers are generally associated, on account of their collaboration.
Paul Marguerite, who has given a picture of his
home in Algiers in <i>Le Jardin du passé</i> (1895), was sent to the
military school of La Flèche for the sons of officers, and became
in 1880 clerk to the minister of public instruction. He designed
two pantomimes, <i>Pierrot assassin de sa femme</i> (Théâtre Libre,
1882), and <i>Colombine pardonnée</i> (Cercle funambulesque, 1888),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page707" id="page707"></a>707</span>
in which the traditional Pierrot, played by Margueritte himself,
became a nervous, tragic creature. He resigned his clerkship
in 1889 to devote himself entirely to literature, producing in
rapid succession a series of novels, among which were <i>Tous
quatre</i> (1885), <i>La Confession posthume</i> (1886), <i>Maison ouverte</i>
(1887), <i>Pascal Géfosse</i> (1887), <i>Jours d&rsquo;épreuve</i> (1889), <i>Amants</i>
(1890), <i>La Force des choses</i> (1891), <i>Sur le retour</i> (1892), <i>La Tourmente</i>
(1893), <i>Ma grande</i> (1892), <i>Âme d&rsquo;enfant</i> (1894) and <i>L&rsquo;Eau
qui dort</i> (1896). Paul Margueritte had begun as a realistic
novelist, but he was one of the five writers who signed a manifesto
against Zola&rsquo;s <i>La Terre</i>, and he made his reputation by delicate,
sober studies of the by-ways of sentiment. His brother Victor
entered his father&rsquo;s regiment, the 1st chasseurs d&rsquo;Afrique, in 1888,
and served in the army until 1896, when he resigned his commission.
He was already known by some volumes of poetry,
and by a translation from Calderon (<i>La Double méprise</i>, played at
the Odéon, 1898) when he began to collaborate with his brother.
From the time of this collaboration Paul Margueritte&rsquo;s work
gained in colour and force.</p>

<p>Among the books written in common by the brothers, the most
famous is the series known under the collective title, <i>Une Époque</i>,
dealing with the events of 1870-1871, and including the novels
<i>Le Désastre</i> (1898), <i>Les Tronçons du glaive</i> (1900), <i>Les Braves gens</i>
(1901), <i>La Commune</i> (1904). They also collaborated in an <i>Histoire
de la guerre de 1870-1877</i> (1903). These books were founded on a
mass of documentary and verbal information, amassed with great
care and arranged with admirable art; the authors are historians
rather than novelists. The disasters and humiliations of the
campaigns are faithfully described, but are traced to defects of
organization and leadership; while the courage and patriotism
of the army itself is made the basis of an assured confidence
in the destinies of France. <i>La Commune</i> is a bold indictment
of the methods adopted by the victorious party. The novelists
also attacked the laws governing marriage and divorce and
the abuses entailed by the dowry demanded from the bride,
in pamphlets and in the novels, <i>Femmes nouvelles</i> (1899), <i>Les
Deux vies</i> (1902), and <i>Le Prisme</i> (1905). Their literary partnership
was dissolved in 1907. Paul Marguerite was one of the
original members of the Académie de Goncourt.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARHEINEKE, PHILIP KONRAD<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (1780-1846), German
Protestant divine, was born at Hildesheim, Hanover, on the 1st
of May 1780. He studied at Göttingen, and in 1805 was appointed
professor extraordinarius of philosophy at Erlangen; in 1807 he
moved to Heidelberg. In 1811 he became professor ordinarius
at Berlin, where from 1820 he was also preacher at Trinity
Church and worked with Schleiermacher. When he died, on the
31st of May 1846, he was a member of the supreme consistorial
council. At first influenced by Schelling, Marheineke found a
new master in Hegel, and came to be regarded as the leader of the
Hegelian Right. He sought to defend and explain all the orthodox
doctrines of the Church in an orthodox way in the terms of
Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy. The dogmatic system that resulted from
this procedure was inevitably more Hegelian than Christian;
it was in fact an essentially new form of Christianity. Marheineke&rsquo;s
developed views on dogmatics are given in the third
edition (1847) of his <i>Die Grundlehren der christlichen Dogmatik
als Wissenschaft</i>. When he published the first edition (1819) he
was still under the influence of Schelling; the second edition (1827)
marked his change of view. His works on symbolics show
profound scholarship, keen critical insight, and rare impartiality.
The <i>Christliche Symbolik</i> (1810-1814) has been pronounced his
masterpiece.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His other works include <i>Institutiones symbolicae</i> (1812; 3rd ed.,
1830), <i>Geschichte der deutschen Reformation</i> (1816; 2nd ed., 1831-1834);
<i>Die Reformation, ihre Entstehung und Verbreitung in Deutschland</i>

<p><span class="bold">MARIANA, JUAN DE<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (1536-1624), Spanish historian, was
born at Talavera. He studied at the university of Alcalá, and
was admitted at the age of seventeen into the Society of Jesus.
In 1561 he went to teach theology in Rome, reckoning among his
pupils Robert Bellarmine, afterwards cardinal; then passed into
Sicily; and in 1569 he was sent to Paris, where his expositions of
the writings of Thomas Aquinas attracted large audiences. In
1574, owing to ill health, he obtained permission to return to
Spain; the rest of his life being passed at the Jesuits&rsquo; house in
Toledo in vigorous literary activity. He died at Madrid, on the
17th of February 1624.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Mariana&rsquo;s great work, <i>Historiae de rebus Hispaniae</i>, first appeared
in twenty books at Toledo in 1592; ten books were subsequently
added (1605), bringing the work down to the accession of Charles V.
in 1519, and in a still later abstract of events the author completed
it to the accession of Philip IV. in 1621. It was so well received
that Mariana was induced to translate it into Spanish (the first
part in 1601; completed, 1609; Eng. trans., by J. Stevens, 1699).
Mariana&rsquo;s <i>Historiae</i>, though in many parts uncritical, is justly
esteemed for its research, accuracy, sagacity and style. Of his
other works the most interesting is the treatise <i>De rege et regis
institutione</i> (Toledo, 1598). In its sixth chapter the question
whether it is lawful to overthrow a tyrant is freely discussed and
answered in the affirmative, a circumstance which brought much
odium upon the Jesuits, especially after the assassination of
Henry IV. of France, in 1610. A volume entitled <i>Tractatus VII.
theologici et historici</i> (published by Mariana at Cologne, in 1609,
containing in particular a tract, &ldquo;<i>De morte et immortalitate</i>,&rdquo; and
another, <i>&rdquo;De mutatione monetae&rdquo;</i>) was put upon the index expurgatorius,
and led to the confinement of its author by the Inquisition.
During his confinement there was found among his
papers a criticism upon the Jesuits, which was printed after his
death as <i>Discursus de erroribus qui in forma gubernationis societatis
Jesu occurrunt</i> (Bordeaux, 1625), and was reprinted by order of
Charles III. when he banished the Jesuits from Spain.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIANAS,<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> <span class="sc">Mariannes</span>, or <span class="sc">Ladrones</span> (Ger. <i>Marianen</i>), an
archipelago in the north-western Pacific Ocean, in about 12°
to 21° N. and 145° E. With the exception of the island of Guam
(United States) it belongs to Germany, and administratively
forms part of the New Guinea protectorate. It consists of two
groups&mdash;a northern of ten volcanic main islands, of which only
four (Agrigan, Anatahan, Alamagan and Pagan) are inhabited;
and a southern of five coralline limestone islands (Rota, Guam,
Aguijan, Tinian and Saypan), all inhabited save Aguijan. In
the volcanic group an extreme elevation of about 2700 ft. is
reached, and there are craters showing signs of activity, while
earthquakes are not uncommon. Coral reefs fringe the coasts
of the southern isles, which are of slight elevation. The total
area, excluding Guam, is about 245 sq. m. and the population
2500, mostly descendants of the Tagal immigrants from the
Philippines. All the islands except Farallon de Medinilla and
Urracas or Mangs (in the northern group) are more or less densely
wooded, and the vegetation is luxuriant, much resembling that
of the Carolines, and also of the Philippines, whence many species
of plants have been introduced. Owing to the humidity of the
soil cryptogams are numerous, as also most kinds of grasses.
Coco-nut and areca palms, yams, sweet potatoes, manioc, coffee,
cocoa, sugar, cotton, tobacco and mother-of-pearl are the chief
products, and copra is the principal export. Agriculture is
neglected, in spite of the exceptional advantages offered by the
climate and soil. On most of the islands there is a plentiful
supply of water. The native population known to the early
Spanish colonists as Chamorros has died out as a distinct people,
though their descendants have intermarried with the immigrant
Tagals and natives of the Carolines. At the Spanish occupation
in 1668 the Chamorros were estimated at 40,000 to 60,000, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page708" id="page708"></a>708</span>
less than a century later only 1800 remained. They were typical
Micronesians, with a considerable civilization. In the island
of Tinian are some remarkable remains attributed to them,
consisting of two rows of massive square stone columns, about
5 ft. 4 in. broad and 14 ft. high, with heavy round capitals.
According to early Spanish accounts cinerary urns were found
imbedded in the capitals.</p>

<p>The fauna of the Marianas, though inferior in number and
variety, is similar in character to that of the Carolines, and
certain species are indigenous to both colonies. Swine and oxen
run wild, and are hunted when required: the former were known
to the earlier inhabitants; the latter with most other domestic
animals were introduced by the Spaniards. The climate though
damp is healthy, while the heat, being tempered by the trade
winds, is milder than that of the Philippines; the variations of
temperature are not great.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The discovery of this archipelago is due to Magellan, who on the
6th of March 1521 observed the two southernmost islands, and sailed
between them (O. Peschel, <i>Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen</i>,
Stuttgart, 1877). The name <i>Islas de los Ladrones</i> (or &ldquo;Islands of the
Thieves&rdquo;) was given them by the ship&rsquo;s crew of Magellan on account
of the thieving propensity of the inhabitants; and the islands are
still commonly called the Ladrones. Magellan himself styled them
<i>Islas de las Velas Latinas</i> (&ldquo;Islands of the Lateen Sails&rdquo;). San
Lazarus archipelago, Jardines and Prazeres are among the names
applied to them by later navigators. They received the name <i>Las
Marianas</i> in 1668 in honour of Maria Anna of Austria, widow of
Philip IV. of Spain. Research in the archipelago was carried out by
Commodore Anson, who in August 1742 landed upon the island of
Tinian (George, Lord Anson, <i>Voyage round the World</i>, bk. iii., 1748).
The Ladrones were visited by Byron in 1765, Wallis in 1767 and
Crozet in 1772. The entire archipelago (except Guam) together with
the Caroline and Pelew Islands was sold by Spain to Germany for
£837,500 in 1899.</p>

1088, abbot of St Peter&rsquo;s, Regensburg), was an Irishman by
birth, and called Moelbrigte, or servant of Bridget. He was
educated by a certain Tigernach, and having become a monk he
crossed over to the continent of Europe in 1056, and his subsequent
life was passed in the abbeys of St Martin at Cologne and
of Fulda, and at Mainz. He died at Mainz, on the 22nd of
December 1082 or 1083.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Marianus wrote a <i>Chronicon</i>, which purports to be a universal
history from the creation of the world to 1082. The <i>Chronicon</i> was
very popular during the middle ages, and in England was extensively
used by Florence of Worcester and other writers. It was first
printed at Basel in 1559, and has been edited with an introduction by
G. Waitz for the <i>Monumenta Germaniae historica. Scriptores</i> (Bd.

<p><span class="bold">MARIA STELLA,<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> the self-styled legitimate daughter of Philip,
duke of Orleans. According to her, Louis Philippe was not the
son of Philip duke of Orleans, but a suppositious child, his father
being one Lorenzo Chiappini, constable at the village of Modigliana
in Tuscany. The story is that the duke and duchess of Orleans,
travelling under the incognito of Comte and Comtesse de Joinville,
were at this village in April 1773, when the duchess gave
birth to a daughter; and that the duke, desiring a son in order to
prevent the rich Penthièvre inheritance from reverting to his
wife&rsquo;s relations in the event of her death, bribed the Chiappinis to
substitute their newly-born male child for his own.</p>

<p>Maria Stella, the supposed daughter of Chiappini, went on the
stage at Florence, where her putative parents had settled, and
there at the age of thirteen became the wife of the first Lord
Newborough, after whose death she married the Russian Count
Ungern-Sternberg. On the death of her putative father in 1821
she received a letter, written by him shortly before his death,
in which he confessed that she was not his daughter, adding
&ldquo;Heaven has repaired my fault, since you are in a better position
than your real father, though he was of almost similar rank&rdquo;
(<i>i.e.</i> a French nobleman). Maria Stella henceforward devoted
her time and fortune to establishing her identity. Her first
success was the judgment of the episcopal court at Faenza, which
in 1824 declared that the Comte Louis de Joinville exchanged his
daughter for the son of Lorenzo Chiappini, and that the Demoiselle
de Joinville had been baptized as Maria Stella, &ldquo;with the false
statement that she was the daughter of L. Chiappini and his
wife.&rdquo; The discovery that Joinville was a countship of the
Orleans family, and a real or fancied resemblance of Louis
Philippe to Chiappini, convinced her that the duke of Orleans was
the person for whose sake she had been cheated of her birthright,
a conviction strengthened by the striking resemblance which
many people discovered in her to the princesses of the Orleans
family. In 1830 she published her proofs under the title <i>Maria
Stella ou un échange d&rsquo;une demoiselle du plus haut rang contre un
garçon de plus vile condition</i> (reprinted 1839 and 1849). This
coincided with the advent of Louis Philippe to the throne, and
her claim became a weapon for those who wished to throw discredit
and ridicule on the &ldquo;bourgeois monarch.&rdquo; He for his
part treated the whole thing with amused contempt, and Baroness
Newborough-Sternburg de Joinville, or Marie Étoile d&rsquo;Orléans,
as she called herself, was suffered to live in Paris until on the 23rd
of December 1843 she died in poverty and obscurity.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In spite of much discussion and investigation, the case of Maria
Stella remains one of the unsolved problems of history. Sir Ralph
Payne Gallwey&rsquo;s <i>Mystery of Maria Stella, Lady Newborough</i> (London,
1907), is founded on her own accounts and argues in favour of her
point of view. More convincing, however, is Maurice Vitrac&rsquo;s
<i>Philippe-Egalité et M. Chiappini</i> (Paris, 1907), which is based on unpublished
material in the <i>Archives nationales</i>. M. Vitrac seeks to
overthrow Maria Stella&rsquo;s case by an alibi. The duke and duchess
of Chartres could not have been at Modigliana in April 1773, for the
simple reason that they can be proved at that time to have been in
Paris. On the 8th of April the duke, according to the official
<i>Gazette de France</i>, took part in the Maundy Thursday ceremonies at
Versailles; from the 7th to the 14th he was in constant attendance
at the lodge of Freemasons of which he had just been elected grand
master. Moreover, it was impossible for the first prince of the blood
royal to leave France without the royal permission, and his absence
would certainly have been remarked. Lastly, the duchess&rsquo;s accouchement,
a semi-public function in the case of royal princesses, did not
take place till the 6th of October. M. Vitrac identifies the real father
of Maria Stella with Count Carlo Battaglini of Rimini, who died
in 1796 without issue: the case being not one of substitution, but of
ordinary &ldquo;farming out&rdquo; to avoid a scandal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIA THERESA<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (1717-1780), archduchess of Austria, queen
of Hungary and Bohemia, and wife of the Holy Roman emperor
Francis I., was born at Vienna on the 13th of May 1717. She was
the eldest daughter of the Emperor Charles VI. (<i>q.v.</i>) and his wife
Elizabeth of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. On the 12th of February
1736 she was married to her cousin Francis of Lorraine (<i>q.v.</i>),
then grand duke of Tuscany, and afterwards emperor. Five sons
and eleven daughters were born of this marriage. From the
date of her father&rsquo;s death on the 20th of October 1740, till her
own death in 1780, Maria Theresa was one of the central figures
in the wars and politics of Europe. But unlike some sovereigns,
whose reigns have been agitated, but whose personal character
has left little trace, Maria Theresa had a strong and in the main
a noble individuality. Her great qualities were relieved by
human traits which make her more sympathetic. It must be
allowed that she was fairly open to the criticism implied in a
husbandly jest attributed to Francis I. While they were returning
from the opera house at Vienna she said to him that the singer
they had just heard was the greatest actress who had ever lived,
and he answered &ldquo;Next to you, Madam.&rdquo; Maria Theresa had
undoubtedly an instinctive histrionic sense of the perspective of
the theatre, and could adopt the appropriate attitude and gesture,
passionate, dignified or pathetic, required to impress those she
wished to influence. But there was no affectation in her assumption
of a becoming bearing or in her picturesque words. The
common story, that she appeared before the Hungarian magnates
in the diet at Pressburg in 1741 with her infant son, afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page709" id="page709"></a>709</span>
Joseph II., in her arms, and so worked on their feelings that they
shouted <i>Moriamur pro rege nostro Maria Theresia</i>, is only
mythically true. But during the delicate negotiations which
were required to secure the support of the Hungarian nobles
she undoubtedly did appeal to them with passionate eloquence,
and, we may believe, with a very pardonable sense of the
advantage she obtained from her youth, her beauty and her sex.
Her beauty, inherited from her mother, was of an open and noble
German type. The official portrait by Muytens, engraved by
Petit, gives a less convincing impression that an excellent chalk
drawing of the head by Gabriel Mattei. In the conflict between
her sense of what was morally just and her sense of duty to the
state she laid herself open to the scoffing taunt of Frederick of
Prussia, who said that in the first partition of Poland <i>elle pleurait
et prenait toujours</i>. But the king of Prussia&rsquo;s taunt is deprived
of its sting by the almost incredible candour of her own words
to Kaunitz, that if she was to lose her reputation before God and
man for respecting the rights of others it must not be for a small
advantage&mdash;if, in fact, Austria was to share in the plunder of
Poland, she was to be consoled for the distress caused to her
feelings by the magnitude of her share of the booty. There was
no hypocrisy in the tears of the empress. Her intellectual
honesty was as perfect as Frederick&rsquo;s own, and she was as incapable
as he was of endeavouring to blind herself to the quality
of her own acts. No ruler was ever more loyal to a conception of
duty. Maria Theresa considered herself first and foremost as the
heiress of the rights of the house of Austria. Therefore, when her
inheritance was assailed at the beginning of her reign, she fought
for it with every weapon an honest woman could employ, and
for years she cherished the hope of recovering the lost province
of Silesia, conquered by Frederick. Her practical sense showed
her the necessity of submitting to spoliation when she was overpowered.
She accepted the peace of Berlin in 1742 in order to
have a free hand against her Bavarian enemy, the emperor
Charles VII. (<i>q.v.</i>). When Frederick renewed the war she accepted
the struggle cheerfully, because she hoped to recover her own.
Down to the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 she went on fighting
for Silesia or its equivalent. In the years following the peace
she applied herself to finding allies in France and Russia who
would help her to recover Silesia. Here, as later in the case of
Poland, she subordinated her feelings to her duty to the state.
Though she denied that she had ever written directly to Madame
de Pompadour, it is certain that she allowed her ministers to
make use of the favourite&rsquo;s influence over the French king.
When fate decided against her in the Seven Years&rsquo; War she bowed
to the inevitable, and was thenceforward a resolute advocate of
peace.</p>

<p>In her internal government she showed herself anxious to
promote the prosperity of her people, and to give more unity to
an administration made up by the juxtaposition of many states
and races with different characters and constitutions. Her
instincts, like those of her enemy Frederick and her son Joseph
II., were emphatically absolutist. She suspended the meetings
of the estates in most parts of her dominions. She was able to
do so because the mass of her subjects found her hand much
lighter than that of the privileged classes who composed these
bodies. Education, trade, religious toleration, the emancipation
of the agricultural population from feudal burdens&mdash;all had her
approval up to a certain point. She would favour them, but on
the distinct condition that nothing was to be done to weaken the
bonds of authority. She took part in the suppression of the
Jesuits, and she resisted the pope in the interest of the state.
Her methods were those of her cautious younger son, Leopold II.,
and not of her eldest son and immediate successor, Joseph II.
She did not give her consent even to the suppression of torture
in legal procedure without hesitation, lest the authority of the
law should be weakened. Her caution had its reward, for whatever
she did was permanently gained, whereas her successor in
his boundless zeal for reform brought his empire to the verge of a
general rebellion.</p>

<p>In her private life Maria Theresa was equally the servant of
the state and the sovereign of all about her. She was an
affectionate wife to her husband Francis I.; but she was always
the queen of Hungary and Bohemia and archduchess of Austria,
like her ancestress, Isabella the Catholic, who never forgot,
nor allowed her husband to forget, that she was &ldquo;proprietary
queen&rdquo; of Castile and Leon. She married her daughters in
the interest of Austria, and taught them <i>not</i> to forget their
people and their father&rsquo;s house. In the case of Marie Antoinette
(<i>q.v.</i>), who married the dauphin, afterwards Louis XVI., she
gave an extraordinary proof of her readiness to subordinate
everything to the reason of state. She instructed her daughter
to show a proper respect to her husband&rsquo;s grandfather, Louis XV.,
by behaving with politeness to his mistresses, in order that the
alliance between the two courts might run no risk. The signing
of the peace of Teschen, which averted a great war with Prussia,
on the 13th of May 1779, was the last great act of her reign,
and so Maria Theresa judged it to be in a letter to Prince
Kaunitz; she said that she had now finished her life&rsquo;s journey
and could sing a <i>Te Deum</i>, for she had secured the repose of her
people at whatever cost to herself. The rest, she said, would
not last long. Her fatal illness developed in the autumn of
the following year, and she died on the 28th of November 1780.
When she lay painfully on her deathbed her son Joseph said to
her, &ldquo;You are not at ease,&rdquo; and her last words were the answer,
&ldquo;I am sufficiently at my ease to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIE AMÉLIE THÉRÈSE<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> (1782-1866), queen of Louis
Philippe, king of the French, was the daughter of Ferdinand IV.,
king of Naples, and the archduchess Maria Carolina, daughter of
the empress Maria Theresa, and belonged to the house of Bourbon.
She was born at Caserta, on the 26th of April 1782, and received
a careful education which developed the naturally pious and
honourable disposition that earned for her in the family circle
the nickname of La Santa. Driven from Naples in 1798, the
Neapolitan royal family fled to Palermo, and the years from 1800
to 1802 were spent by Marie Amélie with her mother at the
Austrian court. In 1806 they were again in flight before the
armies of Masséna, and it was during the second residence
of her father&rsquo;s court at Palermo that she met the exiled
Louis Philippe, then duke of Orleans, whom she married in
November 1809. Returning to France in 1814, the duke and
duchess of Orleans had barely established themselves in the
Palais Royal in Paris when the Hundred Days drove them into
exile. Marie Amélie took refuge with her four children in England,
where she spent two years at Orleans House, Twickenham.
Again in France in 1817, her life at Neuilly until 1828 was the
happiest period of her existence. Neither then nor at any other
time did she take any active share in politics; but she was not
without indirect influence on affairs, because her strong royalist
and legitimist traditions prevented the court from including her
in the suspicion with which her husband&rsquo;s liberal views were
regarded. Her attention was absorbed by the care and education
of her numerous family, even after the revolution of 1830
had made her queen of the French, a position accepted by her
with forebodings of disaster justified by her early experience of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page710" id="page710"></a>710</span>
revolutions. During her second exile, from 1848 to the end of
her life, she lived at Claremont, where her charity and piety
endeared her to the many English friends of the Orleans family.
Marie Amélie died at Claremont, on the 24th of March 1866.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIE ANTOINETTE<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> (1755-1793), queen of France, ninth
child of Maria Theresa and the emperor Francis I., was born at
Vienna, on the 2nd of November 1755. She was brought up
under a simple and austere régime and educated with a view to
the French marriage arranged by Maria Theresa, the abbé
Vermond being appointed as her tutor in 1769. Her marriage
with the dauphin, which took place at Versailles on the 16th of
May 1770, was intended to crown the policy of Choiseul and confirm
the alliance between Austria and France. This fact, combined
with her youth and the extreme corruption of the French
court, made her position very difficult. Madame du Barry,
whose influence over Louis XV. was at that time supreme, formed
the centre of a powerful anti-Choiseul cabal, which succeeded in
less than a year after the dauphin&rsquo;s marriage in bringing about
the fall of Choiseul and seriously threatening the stability of the
Austrian alliance. Thus the young princess was surrounded by
enemies both at court and in the dauphin&rsquo;s household, and came
to rely almost entirely upon the Austrian ambassador, the comte
de Mercy-Argenteau, whom Maria Theresa had instructed to act
as her mentor, at the same time arranging that she herself should
be kept informed of all that concerned her daughter, so that she
might at once advise her and safeguard the alliance. Hence arose
the famous secret correspondence of Mercy-Argenteau, an invaluable
record of all the details of Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s life from
her marriage in 1770 till the death of Maria Theresa in 1780.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette soon won the affection and confidence of the
dauphin and endeared herself to the king, but her position was
precarious, and both Mercy and Maria Theresa had continually
to urge her to conquer her violent dislike for the favourite and
try to conciliate her.</p>

<p>The accession of the young king and queen on the death of
Louis XV. (May 10, 1774), was hailed with great popular enthusiasm.
But her first steps brought Marie Antoinette into open
hostility with the anti-Austrian party. She was urgent in obtaining
the dismissal of d&rsquo;Aiguillon, and did all in her power to secure
the recall of Choiseul, though without success. Thus from the
very first she appeared in the light of a partisan, having against
her all the enemies of Choiseul and of the Austrian alliance, and
was already given the nickname of &ldquo;l&rsquo;autrichienne&rdquo; by mesdames
the king&rsquo;s aunts. At the same time her undisguised impatience
of the cumbrous court etiquette shocked many people, and
her taste for pleasure led her to seek the society of the comte
d&rsquo;Artois and his young and dissolute circle. But the greatest
weakness in her position lay in her unsatisfactory relations
with her husband. The king, though affectionate, was cold and
apathetic, and it was not till seven years after her marriage that
there was any possibility of her bearing him an heir. This fact
naturally decreased her popularity, and as early as September
1774, was made the subject of offensive pamphlets and the like,
as in the case of the <i>affaire Beaumarchais</i>. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Beaumarchais</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The end of the period of mourning for the late king was the
signal for a succession of gaieties, during which the queen displayed
a passion for amusement and excitement which led to
unfortunate results. Being childless, and with a husband who
could not command her respect, her longing for affection led her
to form various intimate friendships, above all with the princesse
de Lamballe and the comtesse Jules de Polignac, who soon
obtained such an empire over her affections that no favour was
too great for them to ask, and often to obtain. Thus for the
benefit of Madame de Lamballe the queen revived the superfluous
and expensive office of superintendent of her household,
which led to constant disagreements and jealousies among her
ladies and offended many important families. In frequenting
the salons of her friends the queen not only came in contact with
a number of the younger and more dissipated courtiers, whose
high play and unseemly amusements she countenanced, but she
fell under the influence of various ambitious intriguers, such as
the baron de Bésenval, the comte de Vaudreuil, the duc de Lauzun
and the comte d&rsquo;Adhémar, whose interested man&oelig;uvres she was
induced to further by her affection for her favourites. Thus she
was often led to interfere for frivolous reasons in public affairs,
sometimes with serious results, as in the case of the trial of the
comte de Guines (1776), when her interference was responsible
for the fall of Turgot. At the same time her extravagance in
dress, jewelry and amusements (including the gardens and
theatricals at Trianon, of the cost of which such exaggerated
reports were spread about) and her presence at horse-races and
masked balls in Paris without the king, gave rise to great scandal,
which was seized upon by her enemies, among whom were Mesdames,
the count of Provence, and the duke of Orleans and the
Palais Royal clique.</p>

<p>At this critical period her brother, the emperor Joseph II.,
decided to visit France. As the result of his visit he left
with the queen a memorandum in which he pointed out to her
in plain terms the dangers of her conduct.<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> He also took advantage
of his visit to advise the king, with such success that at last,
in 1778, the queen had the hope of becoming a mother. For a
time the emperor&rsquo;s remonstrances had some effect, and after the
birth of her daughter, Marie Thérèse Charlotte (afterwards
duchesse d&rsquo;Angoulême) in December 1778, the queen lived a
more quiet life. The death of Maria Theresa (Nov. 29, 1780)
deprived her of a wise and devoted friend, and by removing all
restraint on the rashness of Joseph II. was bound to increase
the dislike of the Austrian alliance and cause embarrassment to
Marie Antoinette. Her position was very much strengthened
by the birth (Oct. 22, 1781) of a dauphin, Louis Joseph Xavier
François, and on the death of Maurepas, which left the king
without a chief minister, she might have exerted a considerable
influence in public affairs had she taken a consistent interest in
them; but her repugnance to serious matters triumphed, and
she preferred to occupy herself with the education of her children,
to whom she was a wise and devoted mother,<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and with her
friends and amusements at Trianon. Personal motives alone
would lead her to interfere in public affairs, especially when
it was a question of obtaining places or favours for her favourites
and their friends. The influence of the Polignacs was now at
its height, and they obtained large sums of money, a dukedom,
and many nominations to places. It was Madame de Polignac
who obtained the appointment of Calonne as controller-general
of the finances,<a name="fa3j" id="fa3j" href="#ft3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and who succeeded Madame de Guéménée as
&ldquo;governess of the children of France&rdquo; after the bankruptcy
of the prince de Guéménée in 1782.<a name="fa4j" id="fa4j" href="#ft4j"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Again, in response to
Mercy and Joseph II.&rsquo;s urgent representations, Marie Antoinette
exerted herself on behalf of Austria in the affairs of the opening
of the Scheldt (1783-1784) and the exchange of Bavaria (1785), in
which, though she failed to provoke active interference on the
part of France, she succeeded in obtaining the payment of
considerable indemnities to Austria, a fact which led to the
popular legend of her having sent millions to Austria, and aroused
much indignation against her. Later, on the recommendation
of Mercy and Vermond, she supported the nomination of Loménie
de Brienne in 1787, an appointment which, though widely
approved at the time, was laid to the queen&rsquo;s blame when it
ended in failure.</p>

<p>Two more children were born to her; Louis Charles, duke of
Normandy, afterwards dauphin, on the 27th of March 1785,
and Sophie Hélène Beatrix (d. June 19, 1787), on the 9th of July
1786. In 1785-1786 the affair of the Diamond Necklace (<i>q.v.</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page711" id="page711"></a>711</span>
revealed the depth of the hatred which her own follies and the
calumnies of her enemies had aroused against her. The public
held her responsible for the bankrupt state of the country; and
though in 1788, following the popular outcry, she prevailed upon
the king to recall Necker, it was impossible for him to avert the
Revolution. The year 1789 was one of disaster for Marie Antoinette;
on the 10th of March her brother Joseph II. died, and on
the 4th of June her eldest son. The same year saw the assembling
of the States-general, which she had dreaded; the taking of
the Bastille, and the events leading to the terrible days of the
5th and 6th of October at Versailles and the removal of the
royal family to the Tuileries. Then began the negotiations with
Mirabeau, whose high estimate of the queen is well-known (<i>e.g.</i>
his famous remark, &ldquo;The king has only one man on his side,
and that is his wife&rdquo;). But the queen was violently prejudiced
against him, believing him among other things to be responsible
for the events of the 5th and 6th of October, and he never gained
her full confidence. She was naturally incapable of seeing the full
import of the Revolution, and merely temporised with Mirabeau.
She dreaded the thought of civil war; and even when she had
realized the necessity for decisive action the king&rsquo;s apathy and
indecision made it impossible for her to persuade him to carry
into effect Mirabeau&rsquo;s plan of leaving Paris and appealing to
the provinces. Her difficulties were increased by the departure
of Mercy for the Hague in September 1790, for Montmorin who
now took his place in the negotiations had not her confidence to
the same extent. Feeling herself helpless and almost isolated
in Paris, she now relied chiefly on her friends outside France&mdash;Mercy,
Count Axel Fersen, and the baron de Breteuil; and it
was by their help and that of Bouillé that after the death of
Mirabeau, on the 8th of April 1791, the plan was arranged of
escaping to Montmédy, which ended in the flight to Varennes
(June 21, 1791).</p>

<p>After the return from Varennes the royal family were closely
guarded, but in spite of this they still found channels of communication
with the outside world. The king being sunk in
apathy, the task of negotiation devolved upon the queen; but
in her inexperience and ignorance of affairs, and the uncertainty
of information from abroad, it was hard for her to follow any
clear policy. Her courageous bearing during the return from
Varennes had greatly impressed Barnave, and he now approached
her on behalf of the Feuillants and the constitutional party.
For about a year she continued to negotiate with them, forwarding
to Mercy and the emperor Leopold II. letters and memoranda
dictated by them, while at the same time secretly warning her
friends not to accept these letters as her own opinions, but to
realize that she was dependent on the Constitutionals.<a name="fa5j" id="fa5j" href="#ft5j"><span class="sp">5</span></a> She
agreed with their plan of an armed congress, and on this idea
both she and Fersen insisted with all their might, Fersen leaving
Brussels and going on a mission to the emperor to try and gain
support and checkmate the <i>émigrés</i>, whose desertion the queen
bitterly resented, and whose rashness threatened to frustrate her
plans and endanger the lives of her family.</p>

<p>As to the acceptance of the constitution (Sept. 1791), &ldquo;tissue
of absurdities&rdquo; though the queen thought it, and much as she
would have preferred a bolder course, she considered that in the
circumstances the king was bound to accept it in order to inspire
confidence.<a name="fa6j" id="fa6j" href="#ft6j"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Mercy was also in correspondence with the Constitutionals,
and in letter after letter to him and the emperor, the
queen, strongly supported by Fersen, insisted that the congress
should be formed as soon as possible, her appeals increasing in
urgency as she saw that Barnave&rsquo;s party would soon be powerless
against the extremists. But owing to the lengthy negotiations
of the powers the congress was continually postponed. On
the 1st of March 1792 Leopold II. died, and was succeeded by
the young Francis II. Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s actions were now
directed entirely by Fersen, for she suspected Mercy and the
emperor of sacrificing her to the interests of Austria (<i>Fersen</i>, i.
251; Arneth, pp. 254, 256, &amp;c.). The declaration of war which
the king was forced to make (April 20) threw her definitely into
opposition to the Revolution, and she betrayed to Mercy and
Fersen the plans of the French generals (Arneth, p. 259; <i>Fersen</i>, ii.
220, 289, 308, 325, 327). She was now certain that the life
of the king was threatened, and the events of the 20th of June
added to her terrors. She considered their only hope to lie in
the intervention of the powers and in the appeal to force, and
endorsed the suggestion of a threatening manifesto<a name="fa7j" id="fa7j" href="#ft7j"><span class="sp">7</span></a> which
should hold the National Assembly and Paris responsible for the
safety of the king and royal family. Immediately after Brunswick&rsquo;s
manifesto followed the storming of the Tuileries and the
removal of the royal family to the Temple (Aug. 10). During
all these events and the captivity in the Temple Marie Antoinette
showed an unvarying courage and dignity, in spite of her failing
health and the illness of her son. After the execution of the king
(Jan. 17, 1793) several unsuccessful attempts were made by her
friends to rescue her and her children, among others by Jarjayes,
Toulan and Lepître, and the &ldquo;baron de Batz,&rdquo; and negotiations
for her release or exchange were even opened with Danton;
but as the allied armies approached her trial and condemnation
became a certainty. She had already been separated from her
son, the sight of whose ill-treatment added terribly to her sufferings;
she was now parted from her daughter and Madame
Elizabeth, and removed on the 1st of August 1793 to the Conciergerie.
Even here, where she was under the closest guard and
subjected to the most offensive espionnage, attempts were made
to rescue her, among others Michonis&rsquo; &ldquo;Conspiration de l&rsquo;oeillet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 14th of October began her trial, her defence being
entrusted to Chauveau-Lagarde and Tronson-Ducourdray. Her
noble attitude, even in the face of the atrocious accusations
of Fouquier-Tinville, commanded the admiration even of her
enemies, and her answers during her long examination were clear
and skilful. The following were the questions finally put to the
jury:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(1) Is it established that man&oelig;uvres and communications have
existed with foreign powers and other external enemies of the republic,
the said man&oelig;uvres, &amp;c., tending to furnish them with
assistance in money, give them an entry into French territory, and
facilitate the progress of their armies?</p>

<p>(2) Is Marie Antoinette of Austria, the widow Capet, convicted
of having co-operated in these man&oelig;uvres and maintained these
communications?</p>

<p>(3) Is it established that a plot and conspiracy has existed tending
to kindle civil war within the republic, by arming the citizens
against one another?</p>

<p>(4) Is Marie Antoinette, the widow Capet, convicted of having
participated in this plot and conspiracy?</p>
</div>

<p>The jury decided unanimously in the affirmative, and on the
16th of October 1793 Marie Antoinette was led to the guillotine,
leaving behind her a touching letter to Madame Elizabeth, known
as her &ldquo;Testament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to the justice of these charges, we have seen how the queen
was actually guilty of betraying her country, though it was only
natural for her to identify the cause of the monarchy with that
of France. To civil war she was consistently opposed, and never
ceased to dissociate herself from the plans of the <i>émigrés</i>, but
here again her very position made her an enemy of the republic.
In any case, all her actions had as their aim&mdash;firstly, the safeguarding
of the monarchy and the king&rsquo;s position, and later,
when she saw this to be impossible, that of securing the safety
of her husband and her son.</p>

important material for her life is to be found in her letters and in the

of Brunswick&rsquo;s manifesto was &ldquo;drafted&rdquo; by Marie Antoinette, <i>i.e.</i>
that the idea of holding Paris responsible for the safety of the royal
family was first suggested by her. He bases this statement entirely
upon the queen&rsquo;s letters of July 3rd to Fersen, of July 4th to Mercy,
the reception of which Fersen notes in his Journal on July 8th and
9th (Fersen ii. 21). But these letters were obviously the answer
to Fersen&rsquo;s letter of June 30th to the queen (Fersen ii. 315), in which
he tells her the terms of the manifesto. Moreover, the suggestion
of holding the Assembly responsible is to be found as early as in the
memo. of the Constitutionals of September the 8th, 1791, and is
included in the Instructions of Mallet du Pan (Mems. ed. Sayous,

that it was he who drew up the manifesto by means of the marquis

<p><span class="bold">MARIE DE FRANCE<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> (<i>fl.</i> <i>c.</i> 1175-1190), French poet and
fabulist. In the introduction (<i>c.</i> 1240) to his <i>Vie Seint Edmund
le Rey</i><a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Denis Pyramus says she was one of the most popular of
authors with counts, barons and knights, but especially with
ladies. She is also mentioned by the anonymous author of
the <i>Couronnement Renart</i>. Her lays were translated into Norwegian<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
by order of Haakon IV.; and Thomas Chestre, who is
generally supposed to have lived in the reign of Henry VI., gave
a version of <i>Lanval</i>.<a name="fa3k" id="fa3k" href="#ft3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Very little is known about her history,
and until comparatively recently the very century in which she
lived remained a matter of dispute. In spite of her own statement
in the epilogue to her fables: &ldquo;Marie ai num, si suis de
France,&rdquo; generally interpreted to mean that Marie was a native
of the Île de France, she seems to have been of Norman origin,
and certainly spent most of her life in England. Her language,
however, shows little trace of Anglo-Norman provincialism.
Like Wace, she used a literary dialect which probably differed
very widely from common Norman speech. The manuscripts
in which Marie&rsquo;s poems are preserved date from the late 13th or
even the 14th century, but the language fixes the date of the
poems in the second half of the 12th century. The <i>Lais</i> are
dedicated to an unknown king, who is identified as Henry II. of
England; and the fables, her <i>Ysopet</i>, were written according to
the <i>Epilogus</i> for a Count William, generally recognized to be
William Longsword, earl of Salisbury. The author of <i>Couronnement
Renart</i>, says that Marie had dedicated her poem to the
count William to whom the unknown poet addresses himself.
This is William of Dampierre (d. 1251), the husband of the
countess Margaret of Flanders, and his identification with Marie&rsquo;s
count William is almost certainly an error. Marie lived and
wrote at the court of Henry II., which was very literary and purely
French. Queen Eleanor was a Provençal, and belonged to a
family in which the patronage of poetry was a tradition. There
is no evidence to show whether Marie was of noble origin or
simply pursued the profession of a <i>trouvère</i> for her living.</p>

<p>The origin of the <i>lais</i> has been the subject of much discussion.
Marie herself says that she had heard them sung by Breton minstrels.
It seems probable that it is the lesser or French Brittany
from which the stories were derived, though something may be due
to Welsh and Cornish sources. Gaston Paris (<i>Romania</i>, vol. xv.)
maintained that Marie had heard the stories from English
minstrels, who had assimilated the Celtic legends. In any case
the Breton lays offer abundant evidence of traditions from
Scandinavian and Oriental sources. The <i>Guigemar</i> of Marie
de France presents marked analogies with the ordinary Oriental
romance of escape from a harem, for instance, with details
superadded from classical mythology. Marie seems to have
contented herself with giving new literary form to the stories
she heard by turning them into Norman octosyllabic verse, and
apparently made few radical changes from her originals. Joseph
Bédier thinks that the lays of the Breton minstrels were prose
recitals interspersed with short lyrics something after the manner
of the cante-fable of <i>Aucassin et Nicolette</i>. Marie&rsquo;s task was to
give these cante-fables a narrative form destined to be read
rather than sung or recited.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>Lais</i> which may be definitely attributed to Marie are:
<i>Guigemar</i>, <i>Equitan</i>, <i>Le Frêne</i>, <i>Le Bisclavret</i> (the werewolf), <i>Les Deux
amants</i>, <i>Laustic</i>, <i>Chaitivel</i>, <i>Lanval</i>, <i>Le Chèvrefeuille</i>, <i>Milon</i>, <i>Yonec</i>
and <i>Eliduc</i>. The other similar lays are anonymous except the <i>Lai
d&rsquo;Ignaure</i> by Renant and the Lai du cor of Robert Biket, two authors
otherwise unknown. They vary in length from some twelve
thousand lines to about a hundred. <i>Le Chèvrefeuille</i>, a short episode
of the Tristan story, telling how Tristan makes known his presence
in the wood to Iseult, is the best known of them all. Laustic<a name="fa4k" id="fa4k" href="#ft4k"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
(<i>Le Rossignol</i>) is almost as short and simple. In <i>Yonec</i> a mysterious
bird visits the lady kept in durance by an old husband, and is
turned into a valiant knight. The lover is killed by the husband,
but in due time is avenged by his son. The scene of the story is
partly laid in Chester, but the fable in slightly different forms occurs
in the folk-lore of many countries.<a name="fa5k" id="fa5k" href="#ft5k"><span class="sp">5</span></a> <i>Lanval</i><a name="fa6k" id="fa6k" href="#ft6k"><span class="sp">6</span></a> is a fairy story, and the
hero vanishes eventually with his fairy princess to the island of
Avallon or Avilion. <i>Eliduc</i> is more elaborately planned than any
of these, and the action is divided between Exeter and Brittany.
Here again the story of the man with two brides is not new, but the
three characters of the story are so dealt with that each wins the
reader&rsquo;s sympathy. The resignation of the wife of Eliduc and her
reception of the new bride find a parallel in another of the lays,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page713" id="page713"></a>713</span>
<i>Le Frêne</i>. The story is in both cases more human and less repugnant
than the, in some respects, similar story of Griselda.</p>

<p>Marie&rsquo;s <i>Ysopet</i> is translated from an English original which she
erroneously attributed to Alfred the Great, who had, she said,
translated it from the Latin. The collection includes many fables
that have come down from Phaedrus, some Oriental stories derived
from Jewish sources, with many popular apologues that belong to
the Renard cycle, and differ from those of older origin in that they
are intended to amuse rather than to instruct. Marie describes the
misery of the poor under the feudal régime, but she preaches resignation
rather than revolt. The popularity of this collection is attested
by the twenty-three MSS. of it that have been preserved.</p>

<p>Another poem attributed to Marie de France is <i>L&rsquo;Espurgatoire
Seint Patriz</i>, a translation from the <i>Tractatus de purgatorio S.
Patricii</i> (<i>c.</i> 1185) of Henri de Salterey, which brings her activity down
almost to the close of the century.</p>

with the help of materials left by Eduard Mall; and <i>Die Lais der
Marie de France</i> (2nd ed., 1900), edited by Karl Warnke, with
comparative notes by Reinhold Köhler; the two works being vols.

see <i>Revue de philologie française</i>, viii. 161 seq.; Karl Warnke, <i>Die

<p><span class="bold">MARIE DE&rsquo; MEDICI<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> (1573-1642), queen consort and queen
regent of France, daughter of Francis de&rsquo; Medici, grand duke of
Tuscany, and Joanna, an Austrian archduchess, was born in
Florence on the 26th of April 1573. After Joanna&rsquo;s death in
1578 duke Francis married the notorious Bianca Capello, and
the grand-ducal children were brought up away from their father
at the Pitti Palace in Florence, where after the death of her
brother and sister and the marriage of her elder sister Eleonora,
duchess of Mantua, a companion was chosen for Marie, this being
Leonora Dori, afterwards known as Leonora Galigaï. She
received a good education in company with her half-brother
Antonio. After many projects of marriage for Marie had failed
Henry IV. of France, who was under great monetary obligations
to the house of Medici, offered himself as a suitor although his
marriage with Marguerite de Valois was not yet dissolved; but
the marriage was not celebrated until October 1600. Her eldest
son, the future Louis XIII., was born at Fontainebleau in September
of the next year; the other children who survived were
Gaston duke of Orleans; Elizabeth queen of Spain; Christine
duchess of Savoy; and Henrietta Maria queen of England.
During her husband&rsquo;s lifetime Marie de&rsquo; Medici showed little sign
of political taste or ability; but after his murder in 1610 when
she became regent, she devoted herself to affairs with unfailing
regularity and developed an inherited passion for power. She
gave her confidence chiefly to Concini, the husband of Leonora
Galigaï, who squandered the public money and secured a series
of important charges with the title of Maréchal d&rsquo;Ancre. Under
the regent&rsquo;s lax and capricious rule the princes of the blood and
the great nobles of the kingdom revolted; and the queen, too
weak to assert her authority, consented at Sainte Menehould
(May 15, 1614) to buy off the discontented princes. In 1616 her
policy was strengthened by the accession to her councils of
Richelieu, who had come to the front at the meeting of the states
general in 1614; but Louis XIII., who was now sixteen years old,
was determined to throw off the tutelage of his mother and Concini.
By his orders Concini was murdered, Leonora Galigaï was
tried for sorcery and beheaded, Richelieu was banished to his
bishopric, and the queen was exiled to Blois. After two years
of virtual imprisonment she escaped in 1619 and became the
centre of a new revolt. Louis XIII. easily dispersed the rebels,
but through the mediation of Richelieu was reconciled with his
mother, who was allowed to hold a small court at Angers, and
resumed her place in the royal council in 1621. But differences
between her and the cardinal rapidly arose, and the queen mother
intrigued to drive Richelieu again from court. For a single day
the <i>journée des dupes</i>, the 12th of November 1630, she seemed
to have succeeded; but the triumph of Richelieu was followed
by her exile to Compiêgne, whence she escaped in 1631 to
Brussels. From that time till her death at Cologne on the 3rd of
July 1642 she intrigued in vain against the cardinal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIE GALANTE,<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> an island in the French West Indies. It
lies in 15° 55&prime; N. and 61° 17&prime; W., 16 m. S.E. of Guadeloupe, of
which it is a dependency. It is nearly circular in shape and 55
sq. m. in area. A rocky limestone plateau, rising in the east to
a height of 675 ft., occupies the centre of the island, and from it
the land descends in a series of well-wooded terraces to the sea.
The shores are rocky, there are no harbours, and the roadstead
off Grand Bourg is difficult of access, owing to the surrounding
reefs. The climate is healthy and the soil rich; sugar, coffee and
cotton being the chief products. The largest town is Grand
Bourg (pop. 6901) on the south-west coast. The island was discovered
by Columbus in 1493, and received its name from the
vessel on which he was sailing. The French who settled here
in 1648 suffered numerous attacks both from the Dutch and
the British, but since 1766, except for a short period of British
rule in the early part of the 19th century, they have held
undisturbed possession.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIE LESZCZYNSKA<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> (1703-1768), queen consort of
France, was born at Breslau on the 23rd of June 1703, being
the daughter of Stanislas Leszczynski (who in 1704 became
king of Poland) and of Catherine Opalinska. During a
temporary flight from Warsaw the child was lost, and eventually
discovered in a stable; on another occasion she was
for safety&rsquo;s sake hidden in an oven. In his exile Stanislas
found his chief consolation in superintending the education
of his daughter. Madame de Prie first suggested the Polish
princess as a bride for Louis duke of Bourbon, but she
was soon betrothed not to him but to Louis XV., a step
which was the outcome of the jealousies of the houses of Condé
and Orléans, and was everywhere regarded as a <i>mésalliance</i> for
the French king. The marriage took place at Fontainebleau on
the 5th of September 1725. Marie&rsquo;s one attempt to interfere
in politics, an effort to prevent the disgrace of the duke of
Bourbon, was the beginning of her husband&rsquo;s alienation from her;
and after the birth of her seventh child Louise, Marie was
practically deserted by Louis, who openly avowed his <i>liaison</i>
with Louise de Nesle, comtesse de Mailly, who was replaced in
turn by her sisters Pauline marquise de Vintimille, and Marie
Anne, duchess de Châteauroux, and these by Madame de
Pompadour. In the meantime the queen saw her father
Stanislas established in Lorraine, and the affectionate intimacy
which she maintained with him was the chief consolation
of her harassed life. After a momentary reconciliation with
Louis during his illness at Metz in 1744, Marie shut herself
up more closely with her own circle of friends until her death at
Versailles on the 24th of June 1768.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIE LOUISE<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (1791-1847), second wife of Napoleon I.,
was the daughter of Francis I., emperor of Austria, and of the
princess Theresa of Naples, and was born on the 12th of December
1791. Her disposition, fresh and natural but lacking the
qualities that make for distinction, gave no promise of eminence
until reasons of state brought Napoleon shortly after his divorce
of Josephine to sue for her hand (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napoleon</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Josephine</a></span>).
It is probable, though not quite certain, that the first suggestions
as to this marriage alliance emanated secretly from the Austrian
chancellor, Metternich. The prince de Ligne claimed to have
been instrumental in arranging it. In any case the proposal was
well received at Paris both by Napoleon and by his ministers;
and though there were difficulties respecting the divorce, of
Josephine, yet these were surmounted in a way satisfactory to
the emperor and the prelates of Austria. The marriage took
place by proxy in the church of St Augustine, Vienna, on the 11th
of March 1810. The new empress was escorted into France by
Queen Caroline Murat, for whom she soon conceived a feeling
of distrust. The civil and religious contracts took place at
Paris early in April, and during the honeymoon, spent at the
palace of Compiègne, the emperor showed the greatest regard
for his wife. &ldquo;He is so evidently in love with her,&rdquo; wrote
Metternich &ldquo;that he cannot conceal his feelings, and all his
customary ways of life are subordinate to her wishes.&rdquo; His joy
was complete when on the 20th of March 1811 she bore him a
son who was destined to bear the empty titles of &ldquo;king of Rome&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Napoleon II.&rdquo; The regard of Napoleon for his consort
was evidenced shortly before the birth of this prince, when he
bade the physicians, if the lives of the mother and of the child
could not both be saved, to spare her life. Under Marie Louise
the etiquette of the court of France became more stately and
the ritual of religious ceremonies more elaborate. Before the
campaign of 1812 she accompanied the emperor to Dresden;
but after that scene of splendour misfortunes crowded upon
Napoleon. In January 1814 he appointed her to act as regent
of France (with Joseph Bonaparte as lieutenant-general) during
his absence in the field.</p>

<p>At the time of Napoleon&rsquo;s first abdication (April 11, 1814),
Joseph and Jerome Bonaparte tried to keep the empress under
some measure of restraint at Blois; but she succeeded in reaching
her father the emperor Francis while Napoleon was on his way
to Elba. She, along with her son, was escorted into Austria by
Count von Neipperg, and refused to comply with the entreaties
and commands of Napoleon to proceed to Elba; and her alienation
from him was completed when he ventured to threaten her
with a forcible abduction if she did not obey. During the
Hundred Days she remained in Austria and manifested no desire
for the success of Napoleon in France. At the Congress of Vienna
the Powers awarded to her and her son the duchies of Parma,
Piacenza and Guastalla, in conformity with the terms of the
treaty of Fontainebleau (March, 1814); in spite of the determined
opposition of Louis XVIII. she gained this right for herself owing
largely to the support of the emperor Alexander, but she failed
to make good the claims of her son to the inheritance (see
NAPOLEON II.). She proceeded alone to Parma, where she fell
more and more under the influence of the count von Neipperg,
and had to acquiesce in the title &ldquo;duke of Reichstadt&rdquo; accorded
to her son. Long before the tidings of the death of Napoleon
at St Helena reached her she was living in intimate relations
with Neipperg at Parma, and bore a son to him not long after
that event. Napoleon on the other hand spoke of her in his
will with marked tenderness, and both excused and forgave her
infidelity to him. Thereafter Neipperg became her morganatic
husband; and they had other children. In 1832, at the time
of the last illness of the duke of Reichstadt, she visited him at
Vienna and was there at the time of his death; but in other
respects she shook off all association with Napoleon. Her rule
in Parma, conjointly with Neipperg, was characterized by a
clemency and moderation which were lacking in the other Italian
states in that time of reaction. She preserved some of the
Napoleonic laws and institutions; in 1817 she established the
equality of women in heritage, and ordered the compilation of
a civil code which was promulgated in January 1820. The
penal code of November 1821 abolished many odious customs
and punishments of the old code, and allowed publicity in
criminal trials. On the death of Neipperg in 1829 his place was
taken by Baron Werklein, whose influence was hostile to popular
liberty. During the popular movements of 1831 Marie Louise
had to take refuge with the Austrian garrison at Piacenza;
on the restoration of her rule by the Austrians its character
deteriorated, Parma becoming an outwork of the Austrian
empire. She died at Vienna on the 18th of December 1847.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIENBAD,<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> a town of Bohemia, Austria, 115 m. W. of
Prague by rail. Pop. (1900), 4588. It is one of the most frequented
watering-places of Europe, lying on the outskirts of
the Kaiserwald at an altitude of 2093 ft., and is 40 m. S.W.
of Carlsbad by rail. Marienbad is enclosed on all sides except
the south by gently sloping hills clad with fragrant pine forests,
which are intersected by lovely walks. The principal buildings
are: the Roman Catholic church, which was completed in 1851;
the English church, the theatre, the <i>Kurhaus</i>, built in 1901,
and several bathing establishments and hospitals. The mineral
springs, which belong to the adjoining abbey of Tepl, are eight
in number, and are used both for bathing and drinking, except
the Marienquelle, which is used only for bathing. Some of them,
like the Kreuzbrunnen and the Ferdinandsbrunnen, contain
alkaline-saline waters which resemble those of Carlsbad, except
that they are cold and contain nearly twice the quantity of
purgative salts. Others, like the Ambrosiusbrunnen and the
Karolinenbrunnen, are among the strongest iron waters in the
world, while the Rudolfsbrunnen is an earthy-alkaline spring.
The waters are used in cases of liver affections, gout, diabetes
and obesity; and the patients must conform during the cure to
a strictly regulated diet. Besides the mineral water baths there
are also <i>moor</i> or mud-baths, and the peat used for these baths
is the richest in iron in the world. About 1,000,000 bottles of
mineral water are exported annually.</p>

<p>Amongst the places of interest round Marienbad is the basaltic
rock of Podhorn (2776 ft.), situated about 3 m. to the east, from
which an extensive view of the Böhmerwald, Fichtelgebirge and
Erzgebirge is obtained. About 7 m. in the same direction lies
the old and wealthy abbey of Tepl, founded in 1193. The actual
building dates from the end of the 17th and the beginning of the
18th century, and contains a fine library with a collection of
rare manuscripts and incunabula; near it is the small and old
town of Tepl (pop. 2789). To the north-east of Marienbad
lies the small watering-place of Königswart; near it is a castle
belonging since 1618 to the princes of Metternich, which contains
an interesting museum, created by the famous Austrian statesman
in the first part of the 19th century. It contains, besides
a fine library, a collection of the presents he received during his
long career; numerous autographs, and other historical relics,
a collection of rare coins, armour, portraits and various minerals.</p>

<p>Marienbad is among the youngest of the Bohemian watering-places,
although its springs were known from of old. They
appear in a document dating from 1341, where they are called
&ldquo;the Auschowitzer springs belonging to the abbey of Tepl;&rdquo;
but it was only through the efforts of Dr Josef Nehr, the doctor
of the abbey, who from 1779 until his death in 1820 worked hard
to demonstrate the curative properties of the springs, that the
waters began to be used for medicinal purposes. The place
obtained its actual name of Marienbad in 1808; became a watering-place
in 1818, and received its charter as a town in 1868.</p>

the Prussian province of West Prussia, 30 m. by rail to the S.E.
of Danzig in a fertile plain on the right bank of the Nogat, a
channel of the Vistula, here spanned by a handsome railway
bridge and by a bridge of boats. Pop. (1905), 13,095. Marienburg
contains large chemical wool-cleaning works and several
other factories, carries on a considerable trade in grain, wood,
linen, feathers and brushes, and is the seat of important cattle,
horse and wool markets. Its educational institutions include
a gymnasium and a Protestant normal school. In the old
market-place, many of the houses in which are built with
arcades, stands a Gothic town-hall, dating from the end of the
14th century. The town is also embellished with a fine statue
of Frederick the Great, who added this district to Prussia, and a
monument commemorating the war of 1870-71. Marienburg
is chiefly interesting from its having been for a century and a
half the residence of the grand masters of the Teutonic order.
The large castle of the order here was originally founded in 1274
as the seat of a simple commandery against the pagan Prussians,
but in 1309 the headquarters of the grand master were transferred
hither from Venice, and the &ldquo;Marienburger Schloss&rdquo;
soon became one of the largest and most strongly fortified
buildings in Germany. On the decline of the order in the middle
of the 15th century, the castle passed into the hands of the Poles,
by whom it was allowed to fall into neglect and decay. It came
into the possession of Prussia in 1772, and was carefully restored
at the beginning of the 19th century. This interesting and
curious building consists of three parts, the Alt- or Hochschloss,
the Mittelschloss, and the Vorburg. It is built of brick, in a
style of architecture peculiar to the Baltic provinces, and is
undoubtedly one of the most important secular buildings of the
middle ages in Germany.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIE THÉRÈSE<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (1638-1683), queen consort of France, was
born on the 10th of September 1638 at the Escurial, being the
daughter of Philip IV. of Spain and Elizabeth of France. By
pretending to seek a bride for his master in Margaret of Savoy,
Mazarin had induced the king of Spain to make proposals for the
marriage of his daughter with Louis XIV., and the treaty of the
Pyrenees in 1659 stipulated for her marriage with the French
king, Marie renouncing any claim to the Spanish succession.
As the treaty, however, hinged on the payment of her dowry,
which was practically impossible for Spain, Mazarin could evade
the other terms of the contract. Marie Thérèse was married
in June 1660, when Philip IV. with his whole court accompanied
the bride to the Isle of Pheasants in the Bidassoa, where she
was met by Louis. The new queen&rsquo;s amiability and her undoubted
virtues failed to secure her husband&rsquo;s regard and affection.
She saw herself neglected in turn for Louise de la Vallière,
Mme. de Montespan and others; but Marie Thérèse was too
pious and too humble openly to resent the position in which she
was placed by the king&rsquo;s avowed infidelities. With the growing
influence of Madame de Maintenon over his mind and affections
he bestowed more attention on his wife, which she repaid by
lavishing kindness on the mistress. She had no part in political
affairs except in 1672, when she acted as regent during Louis
XIV.&rsquo;s campaign in Holland. She died on the 30th of July 1683
at Versailles, not without suspicion of foul play on the part of
her doctors. Of her six children only one survived her, the
dauphin Louis, who died in 1711.</p>

of Atlanta. Pop. (1890), 3384; (1900), 4446, of whom 1928
were negroes; (1910), 5940. The city is served by the Louisville
&amp; Nashville, the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis, and the
Western &amp; Atlantic railways, and is connected with Atlanta by
an electric line. Marietta is situated about 1118 ft. above the
sea, has a good climate, and is both a summer and a winter resort.
The principal industries are the manufacture of chairs and paper,
and the preparation of marble for the markets; there are also
locomotive works, planing mills, a canning factory, a knitting
mill, &amp;c. At Marietta there is a national cemetery, in which
more than 10,000 Federal soldiers are buried, and at Kenesaw
Mountain (1809 ft.), about 2<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> m. west of the city, one of the
fiercest battles of the Civil War was fought. After the Confederate
retreat from Dalton in May 1864, General William T.
Sherman, the Federal commander, made Marietta his next
intermediate point in his Atlanta campaign, and the Confederate
commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, established a line of
defence west of the town. After several preliminary engagements
Sherman on the 26th and 27th of June made repeated
unsuccessful attempts to drive the Confederates from their
defences at Kenesaw Mountain; he then resorted to a flanking
movement which forced the Confederate general to retire
(July 2) toward Atlanta. Marietta was settled about 1840,
and was chartered as a city in 1852.</p>

iron-ore abound in the neighbouring region, and the city has
a considerable trade in these and in its manufactures of chairs,
leather, flour, carriages, wagons, boats, boilers, bricks and glass.
In 1905 the factory products were valued at $2,599,287.</p>

<p>Marietta, named in honour of Marie Antoinette, is the oldest
settlement in the state and in the North-west Territory. It was
founded in 1788 by a company of Revolutionary officers from
New England under the leadership of General Rufus Putnam,

incorporated as a town in 1800 and chartered as a city in 1852.
In 1800 the village of Harmar, including the site on which Fort
Harmar was built in 1785, was annexed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIETTE, AUGUSTE FERDINAND FRANÇOIS<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> (1821-1881),
French Egyptologist, was born on the 11th of February 1821 at
Boulogne, where his father was town clerk. Educated at the
Boulogne municipal college, where he distinguished himself and
showed much artistic talent, he went to England in 1839 when
eighteen as professor of French and drawing at a boys&rsquo; school
at Stratford-on-Avon. In 1840 he became pattern-designer to
a ribbon manufacturer at Coventry; but weary of ill-paid exile
he returned the same year to Boulogne, and in 1841 took his
degree at Douai. He now became a professor at his old college,
and for some years supplemented his salary by giving private
lessons and writing on historical and archaeological subjects for
local periodicals. Meanwhile his cousin Nestor L&rsquo;Hôte, the
friend and fellow-traveller of Champollion, died, and upon
Mariette devolved the task of sorting the papers of the deceased
savant. He thenceforth became passionately interested in
Egyptology, devoted himself to the study of hieroglyphs and
Coptic, and in 1847 published a <i>Catalogue analytique</i> of the
Egyptian Gallery of the Boulogne Museum; in 1849, being
appointed to a subordinate position in the Louvre, he left
Boulogne for Paris. Entrusted with a government mission for
the purpose of seeking and purchasing Coptic, Syriac, Arabic
and Ethiopic MSS. for the national collection, he started for
Egypt in 1850; and soon after his arrival he made his celebrated
discovery of the ruins of the Serapeum and the subterraneous
catacombs of the Apisbulls. His original mission being abandoned,
funds were now advanced for the prosecution of his
researches, and he remained in Egypt for four years, excavating,
discovering and despatching archaeological treasures to the
Louvre, of which museum he was on his return appointed an
assistant conservator. In 1858 he accepted the position of
conservator of Egyptian monuments to the ex-khedive, Ismail
Pasha, and removed with his family to Cairo. His history
thenceforth becomes a chronicle of unwearied exploration and
brilliant success. The museum at Bula was founded immediately.
The pyramid-fields of Memphis and Sakkara, and the
necropolis of Meydum, and those of Abydos and Thebes were
examined; the great temples of Dendera and Edfu were disinterred;
important excavations were carried out at Karnak,
Medinet-Habu and Deir el-Bahri; Tanis (the Zoan of the Bible)
was partially explored in the Delta; and even Gebel Barkal in
the Sudan. The Sphinx was bared to the rock-level, and the
famous granite and alabaster monument miscalled the &ldquo;Temple
of the Sphinx&rdquo; was discovered. Mariette was raised successively
to the rank of bey and pasha in his own service. Honours and
orders were showered on him: the Legion of Honour and the
Medjidie in 1852; the Red Eagle (first class) of Prussia in 1855;
the Italian order of SS. Maurice and Lazarus in 1857; and
the Austrian order of Francis-Joseph in 1858. In 1873 the
Academy of Inscriptions decreed to him the biennial prize
of 20,000 francs, and in 1878 he was elected a member of the
Institute. He was also an honorary member of most of the
learned societies of Europe. In 1877 his health broke down
through overwork. He lingered for a few years, working to the
last, and died at Cairo on the 19th of January 1881.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIGNAC, JEAN CHARLES GALISSARD DE<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> (1817-1894),
Swiss chemist, was born at Geneva on the 24th of April 1817.
When sixteen years old he began to attend the École Polytechnique
in Paris, and from 1837 to 1839 studied at the École
des Mines. Then, after a short time in Liebig&rsquo;s laboratory at
Giessen, and in the Sèvres porcelain factory, he became in 1841
professor of chemistry in the academy of Geneva. In 1845 he
was appointed professor of mineralogy also, and held both chairs
till 1878, when ill-health obliged him to resign. He died at
Geneva on the 15th of April 1894. Marignac&rsquo;s name is well
known for the careful and exact determinations of atomic
weights which he carried out for twenty-eight of the elements.
In undertaking this work he had, like J. S. Stas, the purpose of
testing Prout&rsquo;s hypothesis, but he remained more disposed than
the Belgian chemist to consider the possibility that it may have
some degree of validity. Throughout his life he paid great
attention to the &ldquo;rare earths&rdquo; and the problem of separating
and distinguishing them; in 1878 he extracted ytterbia from
what was supposed to be pure erbia, and two years later found
gadolinia and samaria in the samarskite earths. In 1858 he
pointed out the isomorphism of the fluostannates and the
fluosilicates, thus settling the then vexed question of the
composition of silicic acid; and subsequently he studied the
fluosalts of zirconium, boron, tungsten, &amp;c., and prepared
silicotungstic acid, one of the first examples of the complex
inorganic acids. In physical chemistry he carried out many
researches on the nature and process of solution, investigating
in particular the thermal effects produced by the dilution of
saline solutions, the variation of the specific heat of saline
solutions with temperature and concentration, and the phenomena
of liquid diffusion.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIGNAN, BATTLE OF,<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> fought on the 13th and 14th of
September 1515 between the French army under Francis I. and
the Swiss. The scene of the battle&mdash;which was also that of a
hard fought engagement in 1859 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Italian Wars</a></span>)&mdash;was the
northern outskirts of the village of Melegnano, on the river
Lambro, 10 m. S.E. of Milan. The circumstances out of which
the battle of Marignan arose, almost inconceivable to the modern
mind, were not abnormal in the conditions of Italian warfare
and politics then prevailing. The young king of France had
gathered an army about Lyons, wherewith to overrun the
Milanese; his allies were the republics of Venice and Genoa. The
duke of Milan, Maximilian Sforza, had secured the support of
the emperor, the king of Spain, and the pope, and also that of
the Swiss cantons, which then supplied the best and most
numerous mercenary soldiers in Europe. The practicable passes
of the Alps and the Apennines were held by Swiss and papal
troops. Francis however boldly crossed the Col de l&rsquo;Argentière
(Aug. 1515) by paths that no army had hitherto used, and
Marshal de La Palisse surprised and captured a papal corps at
Villafranca near Pinerolo, whereupon the whole of the enemy&rsquo;s
troops fell back on Milan. The king then marching by Vercelli,
Novara and Pavia, joined hands with Alviano, the Venetian
commander, and secured a foothold in the Milanese. But in
order to avoid the necessity of besieging Milan itself, he offered
the Swiss a large sum to retire into their own country. They
were about to accept his offer, not having received their subsidies
from the pope and the king of Spain, when a fresh corps
of mercenaries descended into Italy, desirous both of gaining
booty and of showing their prowess against their new rivals the
French and Lower Rhine &ldquo;lansquenets&rdquo; (Landsknechts) and
against the French gendarmerie, whom (alluding to the &ldquo;Battle
of the Spurs&rdquo; at Guinegatte in 1513) they called &ldquo;hares in
armour.&rdquo; The French took position at Melegnano to face the
Swiss, the Venetians at Lodi to hold in check the Spanish army
at Piacenza. Alviano, who was visiting the king when the Swiss
appeared before Melegnano, hurried off to bring thither his own
army. Meantime the French and the Swiss engaged in an
incredibly fierce struggle.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s army was grouped in front of the village, facing
in the direction of Milan, with a small stream separating it from
the oncoming Swiss. On either side of the Milan road was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page717" id="page717"></a>717</span>
large body of landsknechts, a third being in reserve. The French
and Gascon infantry (largely armed with arquebuses) was on the
extreme right, the various bodies of gendarmerie in the centre.
In front of all was the French artillery. The battle opened in
the afternoon of the 13th of September. As the Swiss advanced
in three huge columns, the French guns fired into them with
terrible effect, but the assailants reached the intersected ground
bordering the stream, and thus protected from the rush of the
French gendarmerie, they debouched on the other side, and fell
upon the landsknechts. The crowd of combatants, the gathering
darkness, and the dust, prevented any general direction being
given to the battle by the leaders of either side. Francis
himself at the head of two hundred gendarmes charged and
drove back two large bodies of Swiss which were pressing the
landsknechts hard. The battle went on by moonlight till close
on midnight, when the Swiss retired a short distance. Both
sides spent the rest of the night on the battlefield, reorganizing
their broken corps. Francis and his gendarmes were the outpost
line of the French army, and remained all night mounted, lance
in hand and helmet on head. Next morning at sunrise, the battle
was renewed. The Swiss now left their centre inactive opposite
the king and with two strong corps attempted to work round
his flanks. That on the left made for the French baggage, but
found it strongly guarded by landsknechts, who drove them
back. The nearest French gendarmerie joined in the pursuit,
but a detachment from the Swiss centre fell upon these and
destroyed them. This detachment in turn followed up its
advantage until as Francis himself expressed it, &ldquo;the whole camp
turned out&rdquo; to aid the landsknechts and &ldquo;hunted out&rdquo; the
Swiss. Meantime the Swiss left attack had closed with the
French infantry bands and the &ldquo;aventuriers&rdquo; (afterwards the
famous corps of Picardie and Piedmont), who were commanded
on this day <span class="correction" title="amended from be">by</span> the famous engineer Pedro Navarro. It was in
the main struggle of arquebus against pike, but it was not the
arquebus alone, or even principally, that gave the victory to the
French. When the Swiss ranks had been disordered, the short
pike and the sword came into play, and aided by the constable
de Bourbon with a handful of the gendarmerie, the French right
more than held its own until Alviano with the cavalry from Lodi
rode on to the field and completed the rout of the Swiss. In the
centre meanwhile the two infantries stood fast for eight hours,
separated by the brook, while the artillery on both sides fired
into it at short range. But the landsknechts, animated by the
king, endured it as well as the Swiss; and at the last, Francis
leading a final advance of his exhausted troops, the Swiss gave
way and fled. Only 3000 Swiss escaped out of some 25,000 who
fought. On the French side probably 8000 were killed or died
of wounds. The battle lasted twenty-eight hours. Its tactical
lesson was the efficacy of combining two arms against one. The
French gendarmerie, burning to avenge the insult of &ldquo;hares in
armour,&rdquo; made more than thirty charges by squadrons, and
they were admirably supported by their light artillery. The
landsknechts retrieved their first day&rsquo;s defeat by their conduct
on the second day. Nevertheless Marignan was in the main
the work of the gendarmerie, the last and greatest triumph of
the armoured lancer; and as a fitting close to the battle the
young king was knighted by Bayard on the field.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MARIGNOLLI, GIOVANNI DE&rsquo;,<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> a notable traveller to the Far
East in the 14th century, born probably before 1290, and sprung
from a noble family in Florence. The family is long extinct,
but a street near the cathedral (Via de&rsquo; Cerretani) formerly bore
the name of the Marignolli. In 1338 there arrived at Avignon,
where Benedict XII. held his court, an embassy from the great
khan of Cathay (the Mongol-Chinese emperor), bearing letters
to the pontiff from the khan himself, and from certain Christian
nobles of the Alan race in his service. These latter represented
that they had been eight years (since Monte Corvino&rsquo;s death)
without a spiritual guide, and earnestly desired one. The pope
replied to the letters, and appointed four ecclesiastics as his
legates to the khan&rsquo;s court. The name of John of Florence,
<i>i.e.</i> Marignolli, appears third on the letters of commission. A
large party was associated with the four chief envoys; when in
Peking the embassy still numbered thirty-two, out of an original
fifty.</p>

<p>The mission left Avignon in December 1338; picked up the
Tatar envoys at Naples; stayed nearly two months in Constantinople
(Pera, May 1-June 24, 1339); and sailed across the
Black Sea to Kaffa, whence they travelled to the court of Mahommed
Uzbeg, khan of the Golden Horde, at Sarai on the Volga.
The khan entertained them hospitably during the winter of
1339-1340 and then sent them across the steppes to Armalec,
Almalig or Almaligh (Kulja), the northern seat of the house
of Chaghatai, in what is now the province of Ili. &ldquo;There,&rdquo;
says Marignolli, &ldquo;we built a church, bought a piece of ground ... sung
masses, and baptized several persons, notwithstanding
that only the year before the bishop and six other minor friars
had there undergone glorious martyrdom for Christ&rsquo;s salvation.&rdquo;
Quitting Almaligh in 1341, they seem to have reached Peking
(by way of Kamul or Hami) in May or June 1342. They were
well received by the reigning khan, the last of the Mongol
dynasty in China. An entry in the Chinese annals fixes the
year of Marignolli&rsquo;s presentation by its mention of the arrival
of the great horses from the kingdom of Fulang (<i>Farang</i> or
Europe), one of which was 11 ft. 6 in. in length, and 6 ft. 8 in.
high, and black all over.</p>

<p>Marignolli stayed at Peking or Cambalec three or four years,
after which he travelled through eastern China to Zayton or
Amoy Harbour, quitting China apparently in December 1347,
and reaching Columbum (Kaulam or Quilon in Malabar) in
Easter week of 1348. At this place he found a church of the
Latin communion, probably founded by Jordanus of Séverac,
who had been appointed bishop of Columbum by Pope John
XXII. in 1330. Here Marignolli remained sixteen months,
after which he proceeded on what seems a most devious voyage.
First he visited the shrine of St Thomas near the modern Madras,
and then proceeded to what he calls the kingdom of Saba, and
identifies with the Sheba of Scripture, but which seems from
various particulars to have been Java. Taking ship again for
Malabar on his way to Europe, he encountered great storms.
They found shelter in the little port of <i>Pervily</i> or <i>Pervilis</i>
(Beruwala or Berberyn) in the south-west of Ceylon; but here
the legate fell into the hands of &ldquo;a certain tyrant Coya Jaan
(Khoja Jah&#257;n), a eunuch and an accursed Saracen,&rdquo; who professed
to treat him with all deference, but detained him four
months, and plundered all the gifts and Eastern rarities that he
was carrying home. This detention in <i>Seyllan</i> enables Marignolli
to give a variety of curious particulars regarding Adam&rsquo;s
Peak, Buddhist monasticism, the aboriginal races of Ceylon, and
other marvels. After this we have only fragmentary notices,
showing that his route to Europe lay by Ormuz, the ruins of
Babel, Bagdad, Mosul, Aleppo and thence to Damascus and
Jerusalem. In 1353 he arrived at Avignon, and delivered a letter
from the great khan to Pope Innocent VI. In the following year
the emperor Charles IV., on a visit to Italy, made Marignolli
one of his chaplains. Soon after, the pope made him bishop of
Bisignano; but he seems to have been in no hurry to reside there.
He appears to have accompanied the emperor to Prague in
1354-1355; in 1356 he is found acting as envoy to the Pope from
Florence; and in 1357 he is at Bologna. We know not when he
died. The last trace of Marignolli is a letter addressed to him,
which was found in the 18th century among the records in the
Chapter Library at Prague. The writer is an unnamed bishop
of Armagh, easily identified with Richard Fitz Ralph, a strenuous
foe of the Franciscans, who had broken lances in controversy
with Ockham and Burley. The letter implies that some intention
had been intimated from Avignon of sending Marignolli
to Ireland in connexion with matters then in debate&mdash;a project
which stirs Fitz Ralph&rsquo;s wrath.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The fragmentary notes of Marignolli&rsquo;s Eastern travels often contain
vivid remembrance and graphic description, but combined with
an incontinent vanity, and an incoherent lapse from one thing to
another. They have no claim to be called a narrative, and it is
with no small pains that anything like a narrative can be pieced out
of them. Indeed the mode in which they were elicited curiously
illustrates how little medieval travellers thought of publication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page718" id="page718"></a>718</span>
The emperor Charles, instead of urging his chaplain to write a history
of his vast journeys, set him to the repugnant task of recasting the
annals of Bohemia; and he consoled himself by salting the insipid
stuff by interpolations, <i>à propos de bottes</i>, of his recollections of
Asiatic travel.</p>

<p>Nobody seems to have noticed the work till 1768, when the
chronicle was published in vol. ii. of the <i>Monumenta hist. Bohemiae
nusquam antehac edita</i> by Father Gelasius Dobner. But, though
Marignolli was thus at last in type, no one seems to have read
him till 1820, when an interesting paper on his travels was published
by J. G. Meinert. Professor Friedrich Kunstmann of Munich also
devoted to the subject one of his admirable series of papers on the
ecclesiastical travellers of the middle ages.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIGNY, ENGUERRAND DE<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (1260-1315), French chamberlain,
and minister of Philip IV. the Fair, was born at Lyons-la-Forêt
in Normandy, of an old Norman family of the smaller
baronage called Le Portier, which took the name of Marigny
about 1200. Enguerrand entered the service of Hugues de
Bonville, chamberlain and secretary of Philip IV., as a squire,
and then was attached to the household of Queen Jeanne, who
made him one of the executors of her will. He married her god-daughter,
Jeanne de St Martin. In 1298 he received the custody
of the castle of Issoudun. After the death of Pierre Flotte and
Hugues de Bonville at the battle of Mons-en-Pevèle in 1304, he
became Philip&rsquo;s grand chamberlain and chief minister. In 1306
he was sent to preside over the exchequer of Normandy. He
received numerous gifts of land and money from Philip as
well as a pension from Edward II. of England. Possessed
of an ingratiating manner, politic, learned and astute, he acted
as an able instrument in carrying out Philip&rsquo;s plans, and
received corresponding confidence. He shared the popular
odium which Philip incurred by debasing the coinage. He acted
as the agent of Philip in his contest with Louis de Nevers, the
son of Robert count of Flanders, imprisoning Louis and forcing
Robert to surrender Lille, Douay and Béthune. He obtained
for his half-brother Philip de Marigny in 1301 the bishopric of
Cambray, and in 1309 the archbishopric of Sens, and for his
brother Jean in 1312 the bishopric of Beauvais. Still another
relative, Nicolas de Fréauville, became the king&rsquo;s confessor and
a cardinal. He addressed the estates general in 1314 and succeeded
in getting further taxes for the Flemish war, incurring
at the same time much ill will. This soon came to a head when
the princes of the blood, eager to fight the Flemings, were disappointed
by his negotiating a peace in September. He was accused
of receiving bribes, and Charles of Valois denounced him to the
king himself; but Philip stood by him and the attack was of no
avail. The death of Philip IV. on the 29th of November 1314
was a signal for a reaction against his policy. The feudal party,
whose power the king had tried to limit, turned on his ministers
and chiefly on his chamberlain. Enguerrand was arrested by
Louis X. at the instigation of Charles of Valois, and twenty-eight
articles of accusation including charges of receiving bribes were
brought against him. He was refused a hearing; but his accounts
were correct, and Louis was inclined to spare him anything
more than banishment to the island of Cyprus. Charles then
brought forward a charge of sorcery which was more effectual.
He was condemned at once and hanged on the public gallows at
Montfaucon, protesting that in all his acts he had only been
carrying out Philip&rsquo;s commands (April 30, 1315). Louis X.
seems to have repented of his treatment of Marigny, and left
legacies to his children. When his chief enemy, Charles of
Valois, lay dying in 1325, he was stricken with remorse and
ordered alms to be distributed among the poor of Paris with
a request to &ldquo;pray for the souls of Enguerrand and Charles.&rdquo;
Marigny founded the collegiate church of Notre Dame d&rsquo;Escoës
near Rouen in 1313. He was twice married, first to Jeanne de
St Martin, by whom he had three children, Louis, Marie and
Isabelle (who married Robert, son of Robert de Tancarville);
and the second time to Alips de Mons.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIGNY, JEAN DE<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> (d. 1350), French bishop, was a younger
brother of the preceding. Entering the church at an early age,
he was rapidly advanced until in 1313 he was made bishop of
Beauvais. During the next twenty years he was one of the most
notable of the members of the French episcopate, and was particularly
in favour with King Philip VI. He devoted himself in
1335 to the completion of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral, the
enormous windows of which were filled with the richest glass.
But this building activity, which has left one of the most notable
Gothic monuments in Europe, was broken into by the Hundred
Years&rsquo; War. Jean de Marigny, a successful administrator and
man of affairs rather than a saintly churchman, was made one of
the king&rsquo;s lieutenants in southern France in 1341 against the
English invasion. His most important military operation, however,
was when in 1346 he successfully held out in Beauvais
against a siege by the English, who had overrun the country up
to the walls of the city. Created archbishop of Rouen in 1347 as
a reward for this defence, he enjoyed his new honours only three
years; he died on the 26th of December 1350.</p>

state. There are now many fine garden varieties of it. The
florets are unisexual, the &ldquo;ray&rdquo; florets being female, the &ldquo;disk&rdquo;
florets male. This and the double variety have been in cultivation
for at least three hundred years, as well as a proliferous form,
<i>C. prolifera</i>, or the &ldquo;fruitful marigolde&rdquo; of Gerard (<i>Herball</i>,
p. 602), in which small flower-heads proceed from beneath the
circumference of the flower. The figure of &ldquo;the greatest double
marigold,&rdquo; <i>C. multiflora maxima</i>, given by Gerard (loc. cit. p. 600)
is larger than most specimens now seen, being 3 in. in diameter.
He remarks of &ldquo;the marigolde&rdquo; that it is called <i>Calendula</i> &ldquo;as
it is to be seene to flower in the calends of almost euerie moneth.&rdquo;
It was supposed to have several specific virtues, but they are
non-existent. &ldquo;The marigold, that goes to bed wi&rsquo; the sun,&rdquo; is
mentioned by Shakespeare, <i>Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>, iv. 3.</p>

<p><i>Tagetes patula</i>, and <i>T. erecta</i>, the French and African marigolds,
are natives of Mexico, and are equally familiar garden
plants, having been long in cultivation. Gerard figures five
varieties of <i>Flos africanus</i>, of the single and double kind
(loc. cit., p. 609). Besides the above species the following have
been introduced later, <i>T. lucida</i>, <i>T. signata</i>, also from Mexico,
and <i>T. tenuifolia</i> from Peru.</p>

<p><i>Chrysanthemum segetum</i>, the yellow corn marigold, is indigenous
to Great Britain, and is frequent in corn-fields in most
parts of England. When dried it has been employed as hay.
It is also used in Germany for dyeing yellow. Gerard observes
that in his day &ldquo;the stalke and leaues of Corne Marigolde, as
Dioscorides saith, are eaten as other potherbes are.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Caltha palustris</i>, the marsh marigold, or king-cups, the
&ldquo;winking Mary-buds&rdquo; of Shakespeare (<i>Cymb.</i>, ii. 3), is a
common British plant in marshy meadows and beside water.
It bears smooth heart-shaped leaves, and flowers with a golden
yellow calyx but no corolla, blossoming in March and April.
The flower-buds preserved in salted vinegar are a good substitute
for capers. A double-flowered variety is often cultivated,
and is occasionally found wild.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARILLAC, CHARLES DE<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1510-1560), French prelate
and diplomatist, came of a good family of Auvergne, and at the
age of twenty-two was advocate at the parlement of Paris.
Suspected, however, of sympathizing with the reformers, he
deemed it prudent to leave Paris, and in 1535 went to the East
with his cousin Jean de la Forêt, the first French ambassador
at Constantinople. Cunning and ambitious, he soon made his
mark, and his cousin having died during his embassy, Marillac
was appointed his successor. He did not return from the East
until 1538, when he was sent almost immediately to England,
where he remained ambassador until 1543. He retained his
influence during the reign of Henry II., fulfilling important
missions in Switzerland and at the imperial court (1547-1551),
and at the courts of the German princes (1553-1554). In
1555 he was one of the French deputies at the conferences held
at Mark near Ardres to discuss peace with England. His two
last missions were at Rome (1557) and at the Diet of Augsburg
(1559). In 1550 he was given the bishopric of Vannes, and in
1557 the archbishopric of Vienne; he also became a member of
the privy council. He distinguished himself as a statesman at
the Assembly of Notables at Fontainebleau in 1560, when he
delivered an exceedingly brilliant discourse, in which he opposed
the policy of violence and demanded a national council and the
assembly of the states general. Irritated by his opposition,
the Guises compelled him to leave the court, and he died on the
2nd of December of the same year.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARINES<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>mare</i>, sea), the technical term for sea-soldiers,
<i>i.e.</i> troops appropriated and specially adapted to the
requirements of maritime war. This force&mdash;formerly (1694)
styled &ldquo;mariners&rdquo;&mdash;is in origin, use and application peculiarly
British. The only other nation possessing a special force discharging
exactly similar functions is the United States (see
below). In the armed forces of the great European Powers
marines and marine artillery are mentioned, but these troops
have little in common with British and American marines. In
France their duties are to garrison military forts and colonies
and take part in marine and other wars. In Germany they are
used for coast defence. In Holland, Austria and Italy they have a
military organization, but not as complements of sea-going ships.</p>

<p>The origin of the British marine force was an order in council
1664, directing &ldquo;1200 Land souldgers to be forthwith rayzed
to be in readiness to be distributed in His Majesty&rsquo;s fleete prepared
for sea service.&rdquo; This body was named the &ldquo;Admiral&rsquo;s
regiment.&rdquo; At this period land warfare had developed a system
and was waged by men organized, disciplined and trained.
Sea warfare was left &ldquo;to every man&rsquo;s own conceit.&rdquo; War-ships
were built to be manned in a hurry, by &ldquo;the press,&rdquo; when needed.
Men were thus obtained by force and grouped without organization
or previous training in ships. When no longer required
they were turned adrift. The administration of England&rsquo;s
fleet was &ldquo;a prodigy of wastefulness, corruption and indolence;
no estimate could be trusted, no contract was performed, no
check was enforced.&rdquo; Such officers as had been &ldquo;bred to the
sea seemed a strange and savage race.&rdquo; They robbed the king
and cheated the seamen. As regards land force, it was a violation
of the law to keep at home in the king&rsquo;s pay &ldquo;any other
body of armed men, save as a guard for the royal person.&rdquo; On
the other hand it was &ldquo;illegal to land press men&rdquo; in a foreign
country, but soldiers &ldquo;only required a little persuasion to land.&rdquo;
Thus by thrusting into naval chaos and confusion a nucleus of
disciplined, trained and organized land troops, an expedient was
found which offered a solution of the many political and administrative
difficulties of the time. This &ldquo;Admiral&rsquo;s regiment.&rdquo;
was the germ which by a constant process of evolution during a
period of over 235 years has produced not merely the marine
forces, but the royal navy, organized, disciplined and trained as
it is to-day. In 1668 the experiment of the Admiral&rsquo;s regiment
was extended. At a council held &ldquo;to discourse about the
fitness for entering men presently for manning the fleete,&rdquo; King
Charles II. &ldquo;cried very civilly, &lsquo;If ever you intend to man the
fleet without being cheated by the captains and pursers, you may
go to bed and resolve never to have it manned.&rsquo;&rdquo; This seems
to throw some light on the council&rsquo;s order a few days later &ldquo;to
draw out and furnish such numbers of His Majesty&rsquo;s Foot
Guards for His Majesty&rsquo;s service at sea this summer, as H.R.H.
the duke of York, lord high admiral of England, shall from time
to time desire.&rdquo; The men were to be paid and accounted for by
their own officers. This maritime force subsequently disappeared,
but two new regiments of &ldquo;marines&rdquo; were raised in 1694,
the House of Commons directing they &ldquo;were to be employed in
the service of the navy only.&rdquo; One regiment only was to be on
shore at a time, and to be employed in the dockyards with
extra pay. None of the officers were to be sea commanders,
save two colonels. The intention was to make these regiments
feeders for the navy, captains being ordered to report periodically
&ldquo;the names of such soldiers as shall in any measure be
made seamen, and how far each of them is qualified toward being
an able seaman.&rdquo; In 1697 these regiments were disbanded, but
early in the reign of Queen Anne a number of regiments of marines
were raised, and independent companies of marines were also
enlisted in the West Indies. At the peace of Utrecht (1713)
the marines were disbanded, but reappeared in 1739 as part of
the army; and in 1740 three regiments of marines were raised
in America, the colonels being appointed by the crown, the
captains by the provinces. In 1747 the marine regiments were
transferred from the control of the secretary at war to that of the
admiralty, and the next year once more wholly disappeared on
the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748).</p>

<p>During the preceding period of fifty-four years the marine
force appeared and disappeared with war. It was a military
body, applied to naval purposes. Its main functions were three-fold&mdash;(1)
for fighting in ships; (2) for seizing and holding land
positions necessary or advantageous to the naval operations of
war; (3) for maintaining discipline of the ships, and by &ldquo;expertness
in handling arms to incite our seamen to the imitation of
them.&rdquo; Incidentally the force came to be regarded as so good
a feeder for the navy that Admiral Vernon (1739) urged &ldquo;the
necessity of converting most of our marching regiments into
marines, and if, as they became seamen they were admitted to
be discharged as such, that would make a good nursery for the
breeding of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The organization of the force was purely military. Regiments
were embarked in fleets, and distributed in the ships. The
officers were interchangeable with those of the guards and line.
John Churchill (afterwards duke of Marlborough) and George
Rooke (afterwards Admiral Sir George Rooke) were together at
one time ensigns of marines. During this period the marines
were never regarded as a reserve for the fleet. The navy in
peace did without them. The necessities of maritime war
demanded a mobile military force adapted to naval conditions
and at naval disposal, and so in all naval operations during these
eighty-four years the marines played a conspicuous part. The
navy had been slowly groping towards a system. For example,
sea officers had been granted a uniform, and a naval academy
(1729) had been established for the education of young gentlemen
for the sea service. But in its main features the navy remained
in 1748 as it was in 1664. The sailor was kidnapped and forced
into ships, to become an outcast when no longer wanted. The
marine when not in a ship was comfortably housed and looked
after by his officers in barracks on shore.</p>

<p>In 1755 the marine force once more reappeared under the
Admiralty, and from that date its history has been continuous.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page720" id="page720"></a>720</span>
But the regimental system was abandoned, and an entirely new
principle of organization was applied. Companies were raised,
and these companies were grouped into great depots, called
divisions, at Portsmouth, Plymouth and Chatham. At these
divisions this force could be increased and reduced at pleasure,
without disturbing the basis of organization, and from them could
be supplied as many or as few sea-soldiers as fleets or ships
needed, while preserving in the varying units so provided all
the essentials of uniformity of system, drill, training, ties of
comradeship and <i>esprit de corps</i>. This force then and for ninety-eight
years afterwards was the only continuously trained,
disciplined and organized fighting force placed by the country at
the disposal of naval officers. On the establishment of this new
marine force the purchase of commissions was abolished, but
interchange with the army was for a time permitted. When
embarked, marines were under the naval code of discipline;
when on shore, under the marine Mutiny Act, identical with that
of the army. When the seamen of the fleet mutinied at the Nore,
at the close of the 18th century, and turned their officers out of
the ships, the marines, undaunted, stood firm by theirs.</p>

<p>Mutiny lurked beneath the deck of many a ship before and
long years after that event. The control of admirals and
captains over their own men was precarious in the extreme.
This was the natural result of the country&rsquo;s neglect of its seamen.
The discipline of the fleet in those days rested on the
firm bayonets of the marines. What England owes to them
may be gathered from Lord St Vincent&rsquo;s recorded testimony:
&ldquo;There never was an appeal made to them for honour, courage
or loyalty, that they did not more than realize my highest
expectation. If ever real danger should come to England, the
marines will be found the country&rsquo;s sheet-anchor.&rdquo; At his
earnest solicitation the marines were made a royal corps in 1802.
It is worthy of note that in those days of masts, yards, sails
and pure seamanship, this greatest of naval statesmen, this
matchless naval strategist, whose practical experience of maritime
war was unrivalled, strenuously advocated as the true
policy for England what in these days of steam and mastless
ships would be scouted and ridiculed. It was to make service
afloat as marines a part of the duty of every regiment of the
line in rotation.</p>

<p>Down to 1804 the marines were an infantry force; the improvement
in artillery towards the close of the century had necessitated
the occasional putting into the fleet of detachments of Royal
Artillery. This, as regards gunnery duties in the fleet, was
repeating on a smaller scale the expedient adopted in the time
of Charles II. So much friction arose between the naval and the
artillery officers that a special corps of Royal Marine Artillery
was raised in 1804, on the recommendation of Nelson. This
special corps fulfilled the expectations of its founders. It was
charged with the care, equipment and working of the larger
ordnance afloat and field-guns ashore, and was employed also as
a body of gunnery instructors to the fleet. In
1831, a certain number of naval officers being
thought to be sufficiently trained in gunnery,
this corps, of which Napier wrote, &ldquo;Never in
my life have I seen soldiers like the Royal
Marine Artillery,&rdquo; was, without warning,
abolished. Then the marine force ceased to
be composed of two corps, artillery and
infantry, and it reverted to a single one of
infantry. Very soon afterwards, however, the
Admiralty began to build up what they had
so suddenly and ruthlessly destroyed, by ordering the conversion
of one company of each infantry marine division into
artillery. The number of these artillery companies gradually
increased, and were grouped in a separate depot. Just as the
wars from Charles II. to George III. had demanded marines,
so the Crimean War led to their increase. Thus in 1859 the
artillery companies of marines were formed into a separate
division, and in 1862 the old name of Royal Marine Artillery
was restored.</p>

<p>The marines thus became once more and still remain two corps,
the official designation of the whole being Royal Marine Forces.
In 1855 the marine infantry corps became light infantry, and in
1869 the Woolwich division (added in 1805) was abolished; and
more recently a marine depot, as a feeder of the other divisions,
was established at Walmer. The headquarters of the R.M.A.
are at Eastney, Southsea. The divisions R.M.L.I. are at
Gosport, Chatham and Devonport. The uniform of the R.M.A.
is blue with red facings, that of R.M.L.I. red with blue facings.
The badge of both corps is the globe surrounded with the laurel
wreath, with the motto &ldquo;Per mare per terram.&rdquo; The Royal
Marine Forces share with the 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards,
the East Kent Regiment (formerly the Buffs), and the Royal
London Militia the privilege of marching through the city of
London with colours flying, bands playing and bayonets fixed.
This is due to a common original association with the London
train bands.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>War Services.</i>&mdash;To describe these would be to review the wars
waged by England by sea and by land for over 200 years. In every
sea fight, great or small, marines have taken part, and on every
continent they have served in big and little wars, sometimes as part
of the army, sometimes with naval contingents, sometimes alone.</p>

<p>Throughout the Napoleonic war the marines took part in every
sort of operation afloat and ashore. During the Crimean War,
mortar-boat flotillas in the Baltic and Black Sea were commanded
and manned by R.M.A., while comrades in the same corps served
with the Royal Artillery in the trenches before Sebastopol&mdash;a marine
infantry brigade occupying the heights of Balaclava. During the
Indian Mutiny, marines (artillery and infantry) served with the
Naval Brigade under Peel. In the China wars batteries and brigades
of the marine force played a prominent part, and likewise were
represented in all the Egyptian and Sudan campaigns, 1881 to 1898.
In one action the R.M.A. gunners came to the relief of the Royal
Horse Artillery when exhausted, and fought their guns; in another
the R.M.A., out of the débris of the enemy&rsquo;s Krupp guns captured,
built up one complete gun and fought it with effect; in the final
campaign gunboats were brought up in pieces, put together and
fought by a detachment of the R.M.A.</p>

<p>In 1899 in the Boer War the marine artillery and infantry took
part with the Naval Brigade, maintaining their historic reputation,
and at the battle of Enslin their losses were exceptionally severe.</p>

<p><i>Characteristics of Marine System.</i>&mdash;The recruit first goes to the
depot at Walmer, and is trained as a soldier before joining his division
to complete instruction as a marine. His division is his permanent
military home, from which he goes on service and to which he returns
at its conclusion. Restrictions on marriage, necessary under the
army system, are not necessary in the marine forces. The permanent
home of the wife and family is not broken up by the marine going
abroad; the wife thus can continue any local goodwill in any business
her industry may secure. This fixed home enables a marine to learn
a trade in the workshops of his division which supply the clothing,
&amp;c., to the corps. Marines are enlisted for 12 years, and if of good
character they can re-engage to complete 21 years, entitling to pension.
The periods of service abroad for marines are shorter (generally
3 years), but more constantly recurrent than for the army. The
administrative, as distinct from the instructional, staff necessary for
a marine division is more simple and less expensive than that of a
numerical army equivalent expressed in regiments. The system of
pay and accounts is also less complex. The following table shows the
relative proportions of marine forces to the whole navy at different
periods up to the South African War of 1899:&mdash;</p>

<p>The above table indicates a gradual change in naval policy and
practice as regards marines. It will be observed that, concurrently
with the gradual disappearance of masts, sails and yards, the proportion
of marines has steadily declined. Down to very recent times
the marine spent more time ashore than afloat. Now the reverse
is the case.</p>

<p>By the introduction of the Continuous Service Act 1853, the blue-jacket
was placed on exactly the same footing as the marine in respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page721" id="page721"></a>721</span>
of conditions of service and pension, and now the blue-jacket when
not afloat is quartered in barracks. The main difference between the
blue-jacket and marine is the dress and the pay. The blue-jacket
is better paid than the marine. As regards opportunity of discipline,
there is now no difference; and in short, all the reasons for the existence
of a marine force have disappeared except as regards duties
on shore incidental to naval operations of war, <i>e.g.</i> the holding of
ports and the seizing of minor positions necessary to prosecution
of maritime war. The facts that modern ships cannot now as
formerly carry a supernumerary force sufficient for such purposes,
and are more dependent on fixed bases of supply and repair than in
old days, point to a different method of using and applying the
marine force to the sole purpose for which they are now necessary
as a distinct branch of the naval service. If employed at the
headquarters of a naval station, their efficiency as marines could be
preserved by occasional embarcation of the officers and men in
rotation. The substitution of marine for army garrisons at coaling
stations would also relieve the army of a class of duties incidental
to naval warfare which the marine force formerly performed, and
which prejudicially affects the organization and arrangement of the
army as a mobile field force.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Marine Corps, United States.</i>&mdash;This dates from the establishment
of the American navy. It is a wholly separate military
body, though under the control of the Navy Department. It
was formed in 1775, and it has a history of brilliant services
rendered by land and sea in all the wars of America since that
date. The headquarters of the corps are at Washington, and the
strength of the corps was fixed by Act of Congress (March 3, 1899)
at 211 officers and 5920 non-commissioned officers and men. Its
organization and system are based on the British model, and the
dress corresponds to that of the United States army. The corps
is commanded by a brigadier-general who bears to the secretary
a relation similar to that of a chief of bureau. Although
the organization closely follows the army system, regimental
or even permanent battalion organizations are impracticable,
owing to their numerous and widely-separated stations.
Practically all shore stations have barracks where marines
are enlisted and drilled. At these places they also do sentry,
police and orderly duties. From such stations they are sent to
ships for sea duty. Nearly all ships carry a body of marines
known as the guard, varying in size from a few men commanded
by a sergeant, on small ships, to eighty or more, with one or more
commissioned officers, on large vessels. It is customary to cause
all marines to serve at sea three of the four years of each enlistment.
On board ship they perform sentry and orderly duty,
and assist in police duties. They are also instructed in many
exercises pertaining to the navy, as rowing, naval signalling,
gun drill, &amp;c. In action they act as riflemen, and on many
ships serve a portion of the guns. When circumstances require
a force to be landed from ships present to guard American
interests in foreign countries, legations, &amp;c., the marine guard is
usually sent, though, if numerically insufficient, sailors are
landed also. Marines also garrison places beyond the territorial
limits of the United States which are under navy
control. Candidates for first enlistment must be between
the ages of 21 and 35 and unmarried, must be citizens of the
United States, be able to read, write and speak English,
and pass a physical examination. Second lieutenants are
appointed from civil life after examination or from the graduates
of the Naval Academy. Promotion is by seniority as in the
navy.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Admiral Farragut&rsquo;s opinion that &ldquo;the marine guard is one of the
great essentials of a man-of-war&rdquo; is corroborated by that of Admiral
Wilkes, who considered that &ldquo;marines constituted the great difference
between a man-of-war and a privateer.&rdquo; In the famous battles
between the &ldquo;Bonhomme Richard&rdquo; and &ldquo;Serapis&rdquo; in 1777, and
in that between the &ldquo;Chesapeake&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shannon,&rdquo; the American
marines displayed brilliant gallantry; and while on the one hand
they at Derne in 1803 first planted the American flag on a fortress of
the Old World, for which exploit &ldquo;Tripoli&rdquo; is inscribed on their
colours, they on the other shared in the hard fighting of the Mexican
War as well as all the important coast actions of the Civil War of
1861-65. A proposal to incorporate them with the army after the
struggle met with universal condemnation from the authorities
best qualified to judge of their value. A brigade of three battalions
served in the Philippines in 1899. Their device is a globe resting on
an anchor and surmounted by an eagle. &ldquo;Ever faithful&rdquo; is the
title which Captain Luce, the historian of the force, appropriately
applies to them.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARINETTE,<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Marinette county,
Wisconsin, U.S.A., 162 m. N. of Milwaukee, on the W. shore of
Green Bay, at the mouth of the Menominee River. Pop. (1890),
11,523; (1900), 16,195, of whom 5542 were foreign-born; (1905),
15,354; (1910), 14,610. It is served directly by the Wisconsin
&amp; Michigan, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul, and the Chicago
&amp; North-Western railways, and by several steamboat lines
connecting with lake ports; and is connected by ferry with
Frankfort, Michigan (served by the Ann Arbor railroad). The
city has a fine harbour and a considerable commerce in iron and
lumber products. Five bridges connect Marinette with Menominee,
Michigan, on the other side of the river. Marinette has a
Federal building; the Stephenson public library, founded by
Senator Isaac Stephenson (b. 1829), a local &ldquo;lumber king&rdquo;; a
county agricultural school and training school for rural teachers,
and three public parks. The Northern Chautauqua Assembly
holds its annual summer session in Chautauqua Park, on the shore
of Green Bay. The growth of Marinette began with the development
of the neighbouring pine forests; and the manufacture of
lumber and lumber products has always been its principal
industry. The water-power of the Menominee River is largely
utilized for the manufacture of paper and flour. Other manufactures
are boxes, furniture and woodware, boats, boilers and agricultural
machinery. In 1905 the factory products were valued
at $3,633,399. The first white settlement was made here on the
site of a Menominee Indian village in 1830, and the city was
named in honour of the daughter of an Indian chief, Marinette
(Jacobs), whose name was a composite of Marie and Antoinette.
A city charter was granted in 1887.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARINI<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Marino</span>), <span class="bold">GIAMBATTISTA</span> (1560-1625), Italian
poet, was born at Naples on the 18th of October 1569. After
a somewhat disreputable youth, during which he became known
for his <i>Canzone de&rsquo; baci</i>, he secured the powerful patronage of
Cardinal Aldobrandini, whom he accompanied from Rome to
Ravenna and Turin. An edition of his poems, <i>La Lira</i>, was
published at Venice in 1602-1614. His ungoverned pen and disordered
life compelled him to leave Turin and take refuge from
1615 to 1622 in Paris, where he was favourably recognized by
Marie de&rsquo; Medici. There his long poem <i>Adone</i> was published in
1623. He died at Naples on the 25th of March 1625. The
licence, extravagance and conceits of Marini, the chief of the
school of &ldquo;Secentisti&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Italy</a></span>: <i>Literature</i>), were characteristic
of a period of literary decadence.</p>

S.E. of it by rail, and also accessible by electric tramway.
Pop. (1901), 7307. It is picturesquely situated on a spur of the
Alban Hills, 1165 ft. above sea level, and occupies the site of
the ancient Castrimoenium, a <i>municipium</i> of no great importance,
though the surrounding district, which now produces much
wine, is full of remains of ancient villas. The origin of the
name is uncertain; perhaps it is derived from the medieval
<i>Morena</i> (itself derived from the Latin <i>Murena</i>, from one of the
Roman owners of the district), a name originally given to the
lower ground between the 9th and 11th mile of the Via Latina.
In the early 13th century it belonged to the Frangipani family,
but passed into the hands of the Orsini in 1266. In 1378 a
battle took place here between the partisans of Urban VI. and
those of the anti-pope Clement VII. of Geneva (the Orsini
having taken the side of the latter), who were, however, defeated;
and in 1399 Marino was apparently under the Papacy. In 1408
it passed to the Colonna family, to whom it still belongs. There
are some remains of the medieval fortifications.</p>

called Martin II., pope from 882 to 884, was the son of a Tuscan
priest, and entered the church at an early age, becoming a
deacon about 862. Three successive popes sent him as legate
to Constantinople, his mission in each case having reference to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page722" id="page722"></a>722</span>
the controversy excited by Photius (<i>q.v.</i>); and having become an
archdeacon and a bishop, he also negotiated on behalf of pope
John VIII. with the emperor Charles the Fat. About the end
of December 882 he succeeded John VIII. as pope, but his election
did not pass unchallenged either in eastern or in western
Europe. However, having secured his position, Marinus
restored Formosus, cardinal-bishop of Porto, and anathematized
Photius. This pope was on friendly terms with the English
king, Alfred the Great. He died in May 884, and was succeeded
by Adrian III.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Marinus II.</span>, sometimes called Martin III., pope from 942

<p><span class="bold">MARINUS,<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> neo-Platonist philosopher, was born in Palestine
and was early converted to the old Greek religion. He came to
Athens at a time when, with the exception of Proclus, there was
a great dearth of eminent men in the neo-Platonic school. It
was for this reason rather than for any striking ability of his
own that he succeeded to the headship of the school on the
death of Proclus. During this period the professors of the old
Greek religion suffered severe persecution at the hands of the
Christians and Marinus was compelled to seek refuge at
Epidaurus. His chief work was a biography of Proclus, which
is extant. It was first published with the works of Marcus
Antoninus in 1559; it was republished separately by Fabricius
at Hamburg in 1700, and re-edited in 1814 by Boissonade with
emendations and notes. Other philosophical works are attributed
to him, including commentaries on Aristotle and on the
<i>Philebus</i>. It is said that he destroyed the latter because Isidore,
his successor, expressed disapproval of it.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIO, GIUSEPPE,<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count of Candia</span> (1810-1883), Italian
singer, the most famous tenor of the 19th century, son of General
di Candia, was born at Cagliari in 1810. His career as a singer
was the result of accidental circumstances. While serving as an
officer in the Sardinian army he was imprisoned at Cagliari for
some trifling offence. When his period of confinement was over,
he resigned his commission. His resignation was refused, and
he fled to Paris. There his success as an amateur vocalist
produced an offer of an engagement at the Opera. He studied
singing for two years under M. Ponchard and Signor Bordogni,
and made his début in 1838 as the hero of Meyerheer&rsquo;s <i>Robert le
Diable</i>. His success was immediate and complete, but he did
not stay long at the Opera. In 1839 he joined the company of
the Théâtre Italien, which then included Malibran, Sontag,
Persiani and Grisi, Rubini, Tamburini and Lablache. His
first appearance here was made in the character of Nemorino
in Donizetti&rsquo;s <i>Elisir d&rsquo;Amore</i>. He sang in London for the first
time in the same year. His success in Italian opera far surpassed
that which he had won in French, and in a short time he acquired
a European reputation. He had a handsome face and a graceful
figure, and his voice, though less powerful than that of Rubini
or that of Tamberlik, had a velvety softness and richness which
have never been equalled. Experience gave him ease as an
actor, but he never excelled in tragic parts. He was an ideal
stage lover, and he retained the grace and charm of youth long
after his voice had begun to show signs of decay. He created
very few new parts, that of Ernesto in <i>Don Pasquale</i> (1843) being
perhaps the only one deserving of mention. Among the most
successful of his other parts were Otello in Rossini&rsquo;s opera of that
name, Gennaro in <i>Lucrezia Borgia</i>, Alamviva in <i>Il Barbiere di
Siviglia</i>, Fernando in <i>La Favorita</i>, and Manrico in <i>Il Trovatore</i>.
Mario made occasional appearances in oratorio singing at the
Birmingham Festival of 1849 and at the Hereford Festival of
1855, and undertook various concert tours in the United Kingdom,
but his name is principally associated with triumphs in
the theatre. In 1856 he married Giulia Grisi, the famous
soprano, by whom he had five daughters. Mario bade farewell
to the stage in 1871. He died at Rome in reduced circumstances
on the 11th of December 1883.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARION, FRANCIS<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> (1732-1795), American soldier, was
born in 1732, probably at Winyah, near Georgetown, South
Carolina, of Huguenot ancestry. In 1759 he settled on Pond
Bluff plantation near Eutaw Springs, in St John&rsquo;s parish,
Berkeley county. In 1761 he served as a lieutenant under
William Moultrie in a campaign against the Cherokees. In 1775
he was a member of the South Carolina Provincial Congress; and
on the 21st of June was commissioned captain in the 2nd South
Carolina regiment under W. Moultrie, with whom he served in
June 1776 in the defence of Fort Sullivan (Fort Moultrie), in
Charleston Harbor. In September 1776 the Continental Congress
commissioned him a lieutenant-colonel. In the autumn of 1779 he
took part in the siege of Savannah, and early in 1780, under
General Benjamin Lincoln, was engaged in drilling militia.
After the capture of Charleston (May 12,1780) and the defeats of
General Isaac Huger at Monk&rsquo;s Corner (Berkeley county, South
Carolina) and Lieut.-Colonel Abraham Buford at the Waxhaws
(near the North Carolina line, in what is now Lancaster county),
Marion organized a small troop&mdash;which usually consisted of
between 20 and 70 men&mdash;the only force then opposing the
British in the state. Governor John Rutledge made him a
brigadier-general of state troops, and in August 1780 Marion
took command of the scanty militia, ill equipped and ill fed.
With this force he was identified for almost all the remainder of
the war in a partisan warfare in which he showed himself a
singularly able leader of irregular troops. On the 20th of August
he captured 150 Maryland prisoners, and about a score of their
British guard; and in September and October repeatedly surprised
larger bodies of Loyalists or British regulars. Colonel
Banastre Tarleton, sent out to capture him, despaired of finding
the &ldquo;old swamp fox,&rdquo; who eluded him by following swamp paths.
When General Nathanael Greene took command in the south,
Marion and Colonel Henry Lee were ordered in January 1781 to
attack Georgetown, but they were unsuccessful. In April,
however, they took Fort Watson and in May Fort Motte, and
they succeeded in breaking communications between the British
posts in the Carolinas. On the 31st of August Marion rescued
a small American force hemmed in by Major C. Fraser with 500
British; and for this he received the thanks of Congress. He
commanded the right wing under General Greene at Eutaw
Springs. In 1782, during his absence as state senator at Jacksonborough,
his brigade deteriorated and there was a conspiracy
to turn him over to the British. In June of the same year he
put down a Loyalist uprising on the banks of the Pedee river;
and in August he left his brigade and returned to his plantation.
He served several terms in the state Senate, and in 1784, in recognition
of his services, was made commander of Fort Johnson,
practically a courtesy title with a salary of £500 per annum.
He died on his estate on the 27th of February 1795. Marion
was small, slight and sickly-looking. As a soldier he was quick,
watchful, resourceful and calm, the greatest of partisan leaders
in the bitter struggle in the Carolinas.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIONETTES<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> (probably from Ital. <i>morio</i>, a fool or buffoon,
but also said to be derived from the <i>mariolettes</i>, or little figures of
the Virgin Mary), <span class="sc">Fantoccini</span> (from <i>fantino</i>, a child) or <span class="sc">Puppets</span>
(Fr. <i>poupée</i> Lat. <i>pupa</i>, a baby or doll), the names given to
figures, generally below life-size, suspended by threads or wires
and imitating with their limbs and heads the movements of
living persons.</p>

<p>The high antiquity of puppets appears from the fact that
figures with movable limbs have been discovered in the tombs
of Egypt and among the remains of Etruria; they were also
common among the Greeks, from whom they were imported to
Rome. Plays in which the characters are represented by puppets
or by the shadows of moving figures, worked by concealed
performers who deliver the dialogue, are not only popular in
India and China, but during several centuries past maintained
an important position among the amusements of the people
in most European countries. Goethe and Lessing deemed them
worthy of attention; and in 1721 Le Sage wrote plays for puppets
to perform.</p>

<p>The earliest performances in English were drawn or founded
upon Bible narratives and the lives of the saints, in the same
vein as the &ldquo;morality&rdquo; plays which they succeeded. Popular
subjects in the 16th century were <i>The Prodigal Son</i> and <i>Nineveh,
with Jonah and the Whale</i>. And in a pamphlet of 1641, describing
Bartholomew Fair, we read, &ldquo;Here a knave in a fool&rsquo;s
coat, with a trumpet sounding or a drum beating, invites you
to see his puppets. Here a rogue like a wild woodman, or in an
antic shape like an incubus, desires your company to view his
motion.&rdquo; In 1667 Pepys recorded how at Bartholomew Fair
he found &ldquo;my Lady Castlemaine at a puppet play, Patient
Grizill.&rdquo; Besides <i>The Sorrows of Griselda</i>, other puppet plays
of the period were <i>Dick Whittington</i>, <i>The Vagaries of Merry
Andrew</i>, and <i>The Humours of Bartholomew Fair</i>. Powell&rsquo;s
noted marionette show was the subject of an article in <i>The
Tatler</i>, 1709, and again in <i>The Spectator</i>, 1711. The latter refers
also to Pinkethman, a &ldquo;motion-maker,&rdquo; in whose scenes the
divinities of Olympus ascended and descended to the strains
of music. An idea of the class of representation may be gathered
from an advertisement of Crawley, a rival of Pinkethman, which
sets forth&mdash;&ldquo;The Old Creation of the World, with the addition
of Noah&rsquo;s Flood,&rdquo; also several fountains playing water during
the time of the play. The best scene represented &ldquo;Noah and
his family coming out of the ark, with all the animals two by
two, and all the fowls of the air seen in a prospect sitting upon
trees; likewise over the ark is the sun rising in a gorgeous manner;
moreover a multitude of angels in a double rank,&rdquo; the angels
ringing bells. &ldquo;Likewise machines descending from above,
double, with Dives rising out of hell and Lazarus seen in
Abraham&rsquo;s bosom; besides several figures dancing jiggs, sarabands,
and country dances, with the merry conceits of Squire
Punch and Sir John Spendall.&rdquo; Yates showed a moving picture
of a city, with an artificial cascade, and a temple&mdash;with mechanical
birds in which attention was called to the exact imitation
of living birds, the quick motion of the bills, just swelling of
the throat, and fluttering of the wings. The puppets were
wax figures 5 ft. in stature. Toward the end of the 18th century,
Flockton&rsquo;s show presented five hundred figures at work at
various trades. Brown&rsquo;s Theatre of Arts showed at country
fairs, from 1830 to 1840, the battle of Trafalgar, Napoleon&rsquo;s
army crossing the Alps, and the marble palace of St Petersburg;
and at a still later date Clapton&rsquo;s similar exhibition presented
Grace Darling rescuing the crew of the &ldquo;Forfarshire&rdquo; steamer
wrecked on the Fern Islands, with many ingenious moving
figures of quadrupeds, and, in particular, a swan which dipped
its head into imitation water, opened its wings, and with flexible
neck preened and trimmed its plumage. In these mechanical
scenes the figures, painted upon a flat surface and cut out,
commonly of pasteboard, are slid along grooves arranged transversely
in front of the set scenery, the actions of legs and arms
being worked by wires from the hands of persons below the
stage, though sometimes use is made of clockwork. In recent
days the literature for the marionette stage has had an important
literary recruit in the person of the Belgian author Maurice
Maeterlinck.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Marionettes proper, and the dolls exhibited in puppet shows (not
including Punch and his companion actors), are constructed of wood
or of pasteboard, with faces of composition, sometimes of wax; and
each figure is suspended by a number of threads to a short bar of
wood which is commonly held in one hand of the hidden performer
while the finger of his other hand poses the figure or gives action
to it by means of the threads. In the mode of constructing the
joints, and the greater elaboration with which the several parts of
the limbs are supported and moved, and especially in the fine degrees
of movement given to the heads, marionettes have been so improved
as to present very exact imitations of the gestures of actors and
actresses, and the postures and evolutions of acrobats; and, in
addition, ingenious exhibitors such as Theodon, who introduced
many novelties in the &rsquo;sixties of the 19th century, have employed
mechanical arrangements for accomplishing the tricks of pantomime
harlequinade. Among the puppet personages presented in the small
street shows are generally included a sailor who dances a hornpipe,
a hoop-dancer, a dancer of the Highland fling, a wooden-legged
pensioner, a vaulter on a pole also balancing two chairs, a clown
playing with a butterfly, a dancing figure without head until the
head rises out of the body, gradually displaying an enormously long
neck, and a skeleton, seen at first in scattered parts lying about the
stage, but piece successively flying to piece, the body first sitting
up, then standing, and finally capped by the skull, when the completed
figure begins to dance.</p>

<p><i>Ombres Chinoises</i> are performances by means of the shadows of
figures projected upon a stretched sheet of thin calico or a gauze
scene painted as a transparency. The cardboard flat figures are
held behind this screen, illuminated from behind&mdash;the performer
supporting each figure by a long wire held in one hand while wires
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page724" id="page724"></a>724</span>
from all the movable parts terminate in rings in which are inserted
the fingers of his other hand.</p>

12th of May 1684. The first volume of the <i>Histoire et mémoires
de l&rsquo;Académie</i> (1733) contains many original papers by him upon
a great variety of physical subjects, such as the motion of fluids,
the nature of colour, the notes of the trumpet, the barometer,
the fall of bodies, the recoil of guns, the freezing of water, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His <i>Essais de physique</i>, four in number, of which the first three
were published at Paris between 1676 and 1679, are his most important
works, and form, together with a <i>Traité de la percussion
des corps</i>, the first volume of the <i>&OElig;uvres de Mariotte</i> (2 vols., Leiden,
1717). The second of these essays (<i>De La nature de l&rsquo;air</i>) contains
the statement of the law that the volume of a gas varies inversely
as the pressure, which, though very generally called by the name
of Mariotte, had been discovered in 1660 by Robert Boyle. The
fourth essay is a systematic treatment of the nature of colour, with
a description of many curious experiments and a discussion of the
rainbow, halos, parhelia, diffraction, and the more purely physiological
phenomena of colour. The discovery of the blind spot is
noted in a short paper in the second volume of his collected works.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIS, JACOB<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> (1837-1899), Dutch painter, first studied at
the Antwerp Academy, and subsequently in Hébert&rsquo;s studio
during a stay in Paris from 1865 till 1871. He returned to
Holland when the Franco-Prussian War broke out, and died
there in August 1899. Though he painted, especially in early
life, domestic scenes and interiors invested with deeply sympathetic
feeling, it is as a landscape painter that Maris will be
famous. He was the painter of bridges and windmills, of old
quays, massive towers, and level banks; even more was he the
painter of water, and misty skies, and chasing clouds. In all
his works, whether in water or oil colour, and in his etchings, the
subject is always subordinate to the effect. His art is suggestive
rather than decorative, and his force does not seem to depend
on any preconceived method, such as a synthetical treatment
of form or gradations of tone. And yet, though his means
appear so simple, the artist&rsquo;s mind seems to communicate with
the spectator&rsquo;s by directness of pictorial instinct, and we have
only to observe the admirable balance of composition and
truthful perspective to understand the sure knowledge of his
business that underlies such purely impressionist handling.
Maris has shown all that is gravest or brightest in the landscape
of Holland, all that is heaviest or clearest in its atmosphere&mdash;for
instance, in the &ldquo;Grey Tower, Old Amsterdam,&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Landscape near Dordrecht,&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Sea-weed Carts, Scheveningen,&rdquo;
in &ldquo;A Village Scene,&rdquo; and in the numerous other
pictures which have been exhibited in the Royal Academy,
London, in Edinburgh (1885), Paris, Brussels and Holland,
and in various private collections. &ldquo;No painter,&rdquo; says M.
Philippe Zilcken, &ldquo;has so well expressed the ethereal effects,
bathed in air and light through floating silvery mist, in which
painters delight, and the characteristic remote horizons blurred
by haze; or again, the grey yet luminous weather of Holland,
unlike the dead grey rain of England or the heavy sky of Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARITIME PROVINCE<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> (Russ., <i>Primorskaya Oblast</i>), a
province of Russia, in East Siberia. It consists of a strip of
territory along the coast of the Pacific from Korea to the Arctic
Ocean, including also the peninsula of Kamchatka, part of the
island of Sakhalin, and several small islands along the coast.
Its western boundary stretches northwards from a point S.W.
of Peter the Great Bay (42° 40&prime; N.) by Lake Hanka or Khanka
and along the Usuri, then goes due north from the mouth of
the Usuri as far as 52° N., runs along the Stanovoi watershed,
crosses the spurs of this plateau through barren <i>tundras</i>, and
finally reaches the Arctic Ocean at Chaun Bay (70° N.). Area,
715,735 sq. m.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The northern part lies between the Arctic Ocean and the Seas
of Bering and Okhotsk, and has the character of a barren plateau
1000 to 2000 ft. high, deeply indented by the rivers of the Anadyr
basin and by long fiords, such as Kolyuchin Bay (the wintering-place
of Nordenskjöld s &ldquo;Vega&rdquo;), the Gulf of Anadyr, and the Bays of
Penzhina and Ghizhiga. To the north this plateau is bordered by
a chain of mountains, several summits of which reach 8000 ft.
(Makachinga peak), while the promontories by which the Asiatic
continent terminates towards Bering Strait run up to 1000 to 2000
ft. Only lichens and mosses, with a few dwarf species of Siberian
trees, grow in this district. The fauna, however, is far richer than
might be expected. A few American birds and mammals cross the
strait when it is frozen. This country, and the seas which surround
it, have for the last two centuries supplied Siberian trade with its
best furs. The blue fox and black sable have been nearly exterminated,
and the whale has become very rare. The sea-otter is rapidly
becoming extinct, as well as the sea-lion (<i>Otaria stelleri</i>); while the
sea-cow (<i>Rhytina stelleri</i>) was completely extirpated in the course
of forty years. The sea-bear (<i>Otaria ursina</i>), which at one time
seemed likely to meet with the same fate, is now nearly domesticated,
and multiplies rapidly. The middle part of the province is a narrow
strip (40 to 60 m. wide) along the Sea of Okhotsk, including the basin
of the Uda in the south. This area is occupied by rugged mountains,
4000 to 7000 ft. high, forming the eastern border of the high plateau
of East Siberia. Thick forests of larch clothe the mountains half
way up, as well as the deep valleys. The undulating hills of the
basin of the Uda, which is a continuation to the south-west, between
the Stanovoi and Bureya mountains, of the deep indentation of the
Sea of Okhotsk, are covered with forests and marshes.</p>

<p>The southern part of the province includes two distinct regions.
From the north-eastern extremity of the Bureya, or Little Khingan
range, of which the group of the Shantar Islands is a continuation,
a wide, deep depression runs south-west to the confluence of the
Amur and the Usuri, and thence to the lowlands of the lower Sungari.
This is for the most part less than 500 ft. above sea-level. The
region on the right banks of the Amur and the Usuri, between these
rivers and the coast, is occupied by several systems of mountains,
usually represented as a single range, the Sikhota-alin. The summits
reach 5150 ft. (Golaya Gora), and the average elevation of the few
passes is about 2500 ft. There is, however, one depression occupied
by Lake Kidzi, which may have been at one time an outflow of the
Amur to the sea. The Sikhota-alin mountains are covered with
impenetrable forests. The flora and fauna of this region (especially
in the Usuri district) exhibit a striking combination of species of
warm climates with those of subarctic regions; the wild vine clings
to the larch and the cedar-pine, and the tiger meets the bear and
the sable. The quantity of fish in the rivers is immense, and in
August the Amur and the Usuri swarm with salmon.</p>

<p>The best part of the Maritime Province is at its southern extremity
in the valley of the Suifeng river, which enters the Pacific in the
Gulf of Peter the Great, and on the shores of the bays of the southern
coast. But even there the climate is very harsh. The warm sea-current
of the Kuro-Siwo does not reach the coasts of Siberia, while
a cold current originating in the Sea of Okhotsk brings its icy water
and chilling fogs to the coasts of Sakhalin, and flows along the Pacific
shore to the eastern coast of Korea. The high mountains of the
sea-coast and the monsoons of the Chinese Sea produce in the southern
parts of the Maritime Province cold winters and wet summers.
Accordingly, at Vladivostok (on the Gulf of Peter the Great), although
it has the same latitude as Marseilles, the average yearly temperature
is only 39.5° F., and the harbour is frozen for nearly three months
in the year; the Amur and the Usuri are frozen in November. Towards
the end of summer the moist monsoons bring heavy rains,
which destroy the harvests and give rise to serious inundations of
the Amur. The sea-coast farther north has a continental and arctic
climate. At Nikolayevsk, temperatures as low as &minus;41.5° F. are
observed in winter, and as high as 94.6° in summer, the average
yearly temperature being below zero (&minus;0.9°). At Ayan (56° 27&prime; N.)
the average temperature of the year is 25.5° (&minus;0.4° in winter and
50.5° in summer), and at Okhotsk (59° 21&prime; N.) it is 23° (&minus;6° in winter
and 52.5° in summer).</p>

<p>Russian settlements occur throughout the whole of the province,
but, with the exception of those on the banks of the Amur and the
Usuri, and the southern ports of the sea-coast, they are mere centres
of administration.</p>

<p>Okhotsk is one of the oldest towns of East Siberia, having been
founded in 1649. Nikolayevsk, on the left bank of the Amur, was
formerly the capital of the Maritime Province; but the difficulties
of navigation and of communication with the interior, and the
complete failure of the governmental colonization of the Amur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page725" id="page725"></a>725</span>
caused the seat of government to be transferred to Khabarovsk.
Since the loss (1905) of Port Arthur to the Japanese, Vladivostok
on Peter the Great Bay has again become the chief naval station
of Russia on the Pacific. The trade is in the hands of the Chinese,
who export stags&rsquo; horns, seaweed and mushrooms, and of the
Germans, who import groceries and spirits.</p>

<p>The total population was 209,516 in 1897, of whom 57.7% were
Russians, the others being Tunguses, Golds, Orochons, Lamuts,
Chuvantses, Chukchis, Koryaks, Ghilyaks and Kamchadales.
Their chief occupations are hunting and fishing; the Russians carry
on agriculture and trade in furs. Active measures were taken in
1883-1897 for increasing the Russian population in the South Usuri
district, the result being that over 29,000 immigrants, chiefly Little
Russian peasants, settled there; while Cossacks from the Don and
Orenburg came to settle among the Usuri Cossacks. Agriculture is
gradually developing in the South Usuri region. Gold-mining has
been started on the Amguñ, a tributary of the Amur. Coal is found
near Vladivostok, as well as in Kamchatka. Roads exist only in
the South Usuri district. A railway runs from Vladivostok to
Nikolsk (69 m.), and thence to Khabarovsk along the right bank
of the Usuri (412 m.). At Nikolsk the Manchurian railway begins.</p>

of Ekaterinoslav, 67 m. W. of Taganrog. Pop. (1900), 52,770,
including the inhabitants of two suburbs, Mariinsk and Kara-su.
The place is said to have been inhabited in remote times under
the name of Adamakha; the present town was built only in
1779, by Greek emigrants from the Crimea. Its inhabitants
are engaged in agriculture, cattle-breeding, fishing, and the
manufacture of leather, agricultural implements, iron goods
and bricks. In export trade Mariupol ranks next to Taganrog
among the ports of the Sea of Azov; but its harbour is open
to the south-east and shallow, though it is being gradually
deepened by systematic dredging. The principal articles of
export are cereals, with some oilcake, phosphate and coal; but
the total value is only about £2,000,000 annually. The imports
do not reach a quarter of a million sterling.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIUS OF AVENCHES<a name="ar142" id="ar142"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Aventicum</span>) (d. 593 or 594),
chronicler and ecclesiastic, was born in the neighbourhood of
Autun probably in 530, and became bishop of Avenches about
573. In addition to being a good bishop, Marius was a clever
goldsmith; he was present at the council of Mâcon in 585, and
transferred the seat of his bishopric from Avenches to Lausanne.
He died on the 31st of December 593 or 594. As a continuation
of the <i>Chronicon</i> of Prosper of Aquitaine, Marius wrote a short
<i>Chronicon</i> dealing with the period from 455 to 581; and although
he borrowed from various sources his work has some importance
for the history of Burgundy. Regarding himself and his land
as still under the authority of the Roman empire, he dates his
<i>Chronicon</i> according to the years of the Roman consuls and of
the East Roman emperors.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The only extant manuscript of the <i>Chronicon</i> is in the British
Museum. Among several editions may be mentioned the one in
the <i>Monumenta Germaniae historica, chronica minora</i>, Band II.

<p><span class="bold">MARIUS, GAIUS<a name="ar143" id="ar143"></a></span> (155-86 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Roman general, of plebeian
descent, the son of a small farmer of Cereatae (mod. <i>Casamare</i>,
&ldquo;home of Marius&rdquo;) near Arpinum. He served first in Spain
under the great Scipio Africanus, and rose from the ranks to
be an officer. In 119 as tribune he proposed a law intended
to limit the influence of the nobles at elections. This brought
him into conflict with the aristocratic party, who prevented
him from obtaining the aedileship. When about forty years
of age he married a lady of patrician rank, Julia, the aunt of
Julius Caesar. This gave him a new social status, and being
at the same time a popular favourite and a brave, energetic
soldier, he was in 115 elected praetor, in which capacity he
effected the subjugation of the troublesome province of Further
Spain. In the war with Jugurtha (109-106) he came to the
front as lieutenant of the consul Quintus Caecilius Metellus
Numidicus. When he had already achieved some important
successes over Jugurtha (<i>q.v.</i>), in 107 he was elected consul for
the first time (an almost unheard-of honour for a &ldquo;new man&rdquo;),
his popularity with the army and people being sufficient to
bear down all opposition. In the following year, in conjunction
with Sulla, he brought the war to a triumphant issue, and passed
two years in his province of Numidia, which he thoroughly
subdued and annexed. The surrender of the person of Jugurtha
to Sulla gave rise to the view that he, not Marius, had really
ended the war, and so laid the foundation of the subsequent
enmity between the two leaders.</p>

<p>By this time Marius was generally recognized as the ablest
general of the day, and was appointed to the chief command
against the Cimbri and Teutones. Two Roman armies had
been destroyed near the Lake of Geneva, and it seemed as if a
repetition of the disaster of the Allia and the capture of Rome
itself might not be impossible. Marius, out of unpromising
materials and a demoralized soldiery, organized a well-disciplined
army, with which he inflicted on the invaders two decisive
defeats, the first in 102 at Aquae Sextiae (<i>Aix</i>), 18 m. north of
Marseilles, and the second in the following year on the Raudian
plain near Vercellae (<i>Vercelli</i>), about midway between Turin
and Milan. For some centuries afterwards Rome remained
unmolested by northern barbarians. In 101 Marius was elected
consul a fifth time (previously in 107, 104, 103, 102), hailed as
the &ldquo;saviour of his country,&rdquo; and honoured with a triumph of
unprecedented splendour.</p>

<p>The glorious part of his career was now over. Though a
very able soldier, he was without the intellectual culture which
the Gracchi, his political ancestors, possessed. As a politician
he on the whole failed, though he retained the confidence of
the popular party almost to the last. But he unfortunately
associated himself with the demagogues <i>Saturninus</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) and
Glaucia, in order to secure the consulship for the sixth time
(100). The manner in which he turned against his former
associates (although he probably had no choice in the matter)
alienated the sympathies of the plebs; and Marius, feeling that
his only chance of rehabilitation lay in war, left Rome for Asia,
where he endeavoured to provoke Mithradates to hostilities.
On his return he served as legate in the Social War (90), and
defeated the Marsi on two occasions. In 88 war broke out with
Mithradates, and Sulla was appointed by the senate to the
chief command, which was eagerly desired by Marius. This
led to a rupture. With the assistance of the tribune Sulpicius
Rufus, Marius succeeded in getting the command transferred
to himself. Sulla marched upon Rome and defeated Marius,
who fled to the marshes of Minturnae in Latium. He was
discovered and taken prisoner; and the local magistrates, in
accordance with Sulla&rsquo;s proclamation, resolved to put him to
death. The Gallic trooper sent to strike off the old man&rsquo;s head
quailed, it is said, before the fire of his eyes, and fled exclaiming,
&ldquo;I cannot kill Gaius Marius.&rdquo; The inhabitants out of compassion
then allowed Marius to depart, and put him on board
a ship which conveyed him to Carthage. When forbidden to
land, he told the messenger to inform the governor that he had
seen Marius sitting as a fugitive among the ruins of Carthage.
Having been joined by his son, he took refuge in the island
of Cercina. Meantime, Sulla having left Italy for the
Mithradatic war, Cinna&rsquo;s sudden and violent revolution put the
senate at the mercy of the popular leaders, and Marius greedily
caught at the opportunity of a bloody vengeance, which became
in fact a reign of terror in which senators and nobles were
slaughtered wholesale. He had himself elected consul for the
seventh time, in fulfilment of a prophecy given to him in early
manhood. Less than three weeks afterwards he died of fever,
on the 13th of January 86.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page726" id="page726"></a>726</span></p>

<p>Marius was not only a great general, but also a great military
reformer. From his time a citizen militia was replaced by a
professional soldiery, which had hitherto been little liked by the
Roman people. He further made the cohort the military unit
instead of the maniple, and his cavalry and light-armed troops
were drawn from foreign countries, so that it may be said that
Marius was the originator of the mercenary army. The Roman
soldier was henceforth a man who had no trade but war. A great
general could hardly fail to become the foremost man in the
state. Marius, however, unlike Caesar, did not attempt to
overturn the oligarchy by means of the army; he used rather
such expedients as the constitution seemed to allow, though
they had to be backed up by riot and violence. He failed as
a political reformer because the merchants and the moneyed
classes, whom the Gracchi had tried to conciliate, feared that
they would themselves be swept away by a revolution of which
the mob and its leaders would be the ultimate controllers.
Marius had a decided tinge of fanaticism and superstition. In
canvassing for the consulship he was guided by the counsels of an
Etruscan soothsayer, and was accompanied in his campaigns
by a Syrian prophetess. The fashionable accomplishments of
the day, and the new Greek culture, were wholly alien to his
taste.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARIVAUX, PIERRE CARLET DE CHAMBLAIN DE<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (1688-1763),
French novelist and dramatist, was born at Paris on the
4th of February 1688. His father was a financier of Norman
extraction whose real name was Carlet, but who assumed the
surname of Chamblain, and then superadded that of Marivaux.
M. Carlet de Marivaux was a man of good reputation, and he
received the appointment of director of the mint at Riom in
Auvergne, where and at Limoges the young Pierre was brought
up. It is said that he developed literary tastes early, and
wrote his first play, the <i>Père prudent et équitable</i>, when he
was only eighteen; it was not, however, published till 1712,
when he was twenty-four. His chief attention in those early
days was paid to novel writing, not the drama. In the three
years from 1713 to 1715 he produced three novels&mdash;<i>Effets
surprenants de la sympathie</i>; <i>La Voiture embourbée</i>, and a book
which had three titles&mdash;<i>Pharsamon</i>, <i>Les Folies romanesques</i>, and
<i>Le Don Quichotte moderne</i>. All these books were in a curious
strain, not in the least resembling the pieces which long afterwards
were to make his reputation, but following partly the
Spanish romances and partly the heroic novels of the preceding
century, with a certain intermixture of the marvellous. Then
Marivaux&rsquo;s literary ardour took a new phase. He fell under
the influence of Antoine Hondar[d] de La Motte, and thought
to serve the cause of that ingenious paradoxer by travestying
Homer, an ignoble task, which he followed up (perhaps, for it
is not certain) by performing the same office in regard to Fénelon.
His friendship for La Motte, however, introduced him to the
<i>Mercure</i>, the chief newspaper of France, where in 1717 he
produced various articles of the &ldquo;Spectator&rdquo; kind, which were
distinguished by much keenness of observation and not a little
literary skill. It was at this time that the peculiar style called
Marivaudage first made its appearance in him. The year 1720
and those immediately following were very important ones for
Marivaux; not only did he produce a comedy, now lost except
in small part, entitled <i>L&rsquo;Amour et la vérité</i>, and another and far
better one entitled <i>Arlequin poli par l&rsquo;amour</i>, but he wrote a
tragedy, <i>Annibal</i> (printed 1737), which was and deserved to be
unsuccessful. Meanwhile his <span class="correction" title="amended from wordly">worldly</span> affairs underwent a sudden
revolution. His father had left him a comfortable subsistence,
but he was persuaded by friends to risk it in the Mississippi
scheme, and after vastly increasing it for a time lost all that
he had. His prosperity had enabled him to marry (perhaps
in 1721) a certain Mlle Martin, of whom much good is said,
and to whom he was deeply attached, but who died very shortly.
His pen now became almost his sole resource. He had a connexion
with both the fashionable theatres, for his <i>Annibal</i> had
been played at the Comédie Française and his <i>Arlequin poli</i> at
the Comédie Italienne, where at the time a company who were
extremely popular, despite their imperfect command of French,
were established. He endeavoured too to turn his newspaper
practice in the <i>Mercure</i> to more account by starting a weekly
<i>Spectateur Français</i> (1722-1723), to which he was the sole
contributor. But his habits were the reverse of methodical;
the paper appeared at the most irregular intervals; and, though
it contained some excellent work, its irregularity killed it. For
nearly twenty years the theatre, and especially the Italian
theatre, was Marivaux&rsquo;s chief support, for his pieces, though
they were not ill received by the actors at the Français, were
rarely successful there. The best of a very large number of
plays (Marivaux&rsquo;s theatre numbers between thirty and forty
items) were the <i>Surprise de l&rsquo;amour</i> (1722), the <i>Triomphe de
Plutus</i> (1728), the <i>Jeu de l&rsquo;amour et du hasard</i> (1730), <i>Les Fausses
confidences</i> (1737), all produced at the Italian theatre, and <i>Le
Legs</i> (1736), produced at the French. Meanwhile he had at
intervals returned to both his other lines of composition. A
periodical publication called <i>L&rsquo;Indigent philosophe</i> appeared in
1727, and another called <i>Le Cabinet du philosophe</i> in 1734, but
the same causes which had proved fatal to the <i>Spectateur</i> prevented
these later efforts from succeeding. In 1731 Marivaux
published the first two parts of his best and greatest work,
<i>Marianne</i>, a novel of a new and remarkable kind. The eleven
parts appeared in batches at intervals during a period of exactly
the same number of years, and after all it was left unfinished.
In 1735 another novel, <i>Le Paysan parvenu</i>, was begun, but this
also was left unfinished. He was elected a member of the Academy
in 1742. He survived for more than twenty years, and was
not idle, again contributing occasionally to the <i>Mercure</i>, writing
plays, &ldquo;reflections&rdquo; (which were seldom of much worth), and
so forth. He died on the 12th February 1763, aged seventy-five
years.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The personal character of Marivaux was curious and somewhat
contradictory, though not without analogies, one of the closest of
which is to be found in Goldsmith. He was, however, unlike Goldsmith,
at least as brilliant in conversation as with the pen. He
was extremely good-natured, but fond of saying very severe things,
unhesitating in his acceptance of favours (he drew a regular annuity
from Helvetius), but exceedingly touchy if he thought himself in any
way slighted. He was, though a great cultivator of <i>sensibilité</i>, on the
whole decent and moral in his writings, and was unsparing in his
criticism of the rising <i>Philosophes</i>. This last circumstance, and
perhaps jealousy as well, made him a dangerous enemy in Voltaire,
who lost but few opportunities of speaking disparagingly of him.
He had good friends, not merely in the rich, generous and amiable
Helvetius, but in Mme de Tencin, in Fontenelle and even in Mme
de Pompadour, who gave him, it is said, a considerable pension, of
the source of which he was ignorant. His extreme sensitiveness is
shown by many stories. He had one daughter, who took the veil,
the duke of Orleans, the regent&rsquo;s successor, furnishing her with her
dowry.</p>

<p>The so-called Marivaudage is the main point of importance about
Marivaux&rsquo;s literary work, though the best of the comedies have great
merits, and <i>Marianne</i> is an extremely important step in the legitimate
development of the French novel&mdash;legitimate, that is, in
opposition to the brilliant but episodic productions of Le Sage.
Its connexion, and that of <i>Le Paysan parvenu</i>, with the work not
only of Richardson but of Fielding is also an interesting though a
difficult subject. The subject matter of Marivaux&rsquo;s peculiar style
has been generally and with tolerable exactness described as the
metaphysic of love-making. His characters, in a happy phrase of
Claude Prosper Jolyot Crébillon&rsquo;s, not only tell each other and the
reader everything they have thought, but everything that they
would like to persuade themselves that they have thought. The
style chosen for this is justly regarded as derived mainly from
Fontenelle, and through him from the Précieuses, though there are
traces of it even in La Bruyère. It abuses metaphor somewhat, and
delights to turn off a metaphor itself in some unexpected and bizarre
fashion. Now it is a familiar phrase which is used where dignified
language would be expected; now the reverse. In the criticism of
Crébillon&rsquo;s already quoted occurs another happy description of
Marivaux&rsquo;s style as being &ldquo;an introduction to each other of words
which have never made acquaintance, and which think that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page727" id="page727"></a>727</span>
will not get on together,&rdquo; a phrase as happy in its imitation as in its
satire of the style itself. This kind of writing, of course, recurs at
several periods of literature, and did so remarkably at the end of
the 19th century in more countries than one. Yet this fantastic
embroidery of language has a certain charm, and suits perhaps better
than any other style the somewhat unreal gallantry and <i>sensibilité</i>
which it describes and exhibits. The author possessed, moreover,
both thought and observation, besides considerable command of
pathos.</p>

<p>The best and most complete edition of Marivaux is that of 1781
in 12 vols. reprinted with additions 1825-1830. The plays had been
published during the author&rsquo;s lifetime in 1740 and 1748. There are
modern editions by Paul de Saint Heylli Victor (1863), by G. d&rsquo;Heylli
(1876) and by E. Fournier (1878), while issues of selections and
separate plays and novels are numerous. Of works concerning him
J. Fleury&rsquo;s <i>Marivaux et le Marivaudage</i> (Paris, 1881), G. Larroumet&rsquo;s
<i>Marivaux, sa vie et ses &oelig;uvres</i> (1882; new ed., 1894), the standard
work on the subject, and G. Deschamps&rsquo;s <i>Marivaux</i> (1897), in the
<i>Grands écrivains français</i>, are the most important. Separate articles
on him will be found in the collected essays of the chief modern
French critics from Sainte-Beuve onwards.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARK, ST,<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> the traditional author of the second Gospel.
His name occurs in several books of the New Testament, and
doubtless refers in all cases to the same person, though this
has been questioned. In the Acts of the Apostles (xii. 12)
we read of &ldquo;John, whose surname was Mark,&rdquo; and gather
that Peter was a familiar visitor at the house of his mother
Mary, which was a centre of Christian life in Jerusalem. That
he was, as his Roman surname would suggest, a Hellenist,
follows from the fact that he was also cousin (&ldquo;nephew&rdquo; is
a later sense of <span class="grk" title="anepsios">&#7936;&#957;&#949;&#968;&#953;&#972;&#962;</span>, see J. B. Lightfoot on Col. iv. 10)
of Barnabas, who belonged to Cyprus. When Barnabas and
Paul returned from their relief visit to Judaea (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 46),
Mark accompanied them (xii. 25). Possibly he had shown
in connexion with their relief work that practical capacity
which seems to have been his distinctive excellence (cf. 2 Tim.
iv. 11). When, not long after, they started on a joint mission
beyond Syria, Mark went as their assistant, undertaking the
minor personal duties connected with travel, as well as with
their work proper (xiii. 5). As soon, however, as their plans
developed, after leaving Cyprus and on arrival at Perga in
Pamphylia (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paul</a></span>), Mark withdrew, probably on some
matter of principle, and returned to Jerusalem (xiii. 13). When,
then, Paul proposed, after the Jerusalem council of Acts xv.,
to revisit with Barnabas the scenes of their joint labours, he
naturally demurred to taking Mark with them again, feeling
that he could not be relied on should fresh openings demand
a new policy. But Barnabas stood by his younger kinsman
and &ldquo;took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus&rdquo; (xv. 38 seq.). Barnabas
does not reappear, unless we trust the tradition which makes
him an evangelist in Alexandria (Clem. <i>Hom.</i> i. 9 seq., cf. the
attribution to him of the Alexandrine <i>Epistle of Barnabas</i>).</p>

<p>When Mark appears once more, it is in Paul&rsquo;s company at
Rome, as a fellow-worker joining in salutations to Christians
at Colossae (Col. iv. 10; Philem. 24). We gather, too, that
his restoration to Paul&rsquo;s confidence took place some time earlier,
as the Colossians had already been bidden by oral message
or letter to welcome him if he should visit them. This points
to a reconciliation during Paul&rsquo;s last sojourn in Jerusalem
or Caesarea. Not long after Col. iv. 10 Mark seems to have
been sent by Paul to some place in the province of Asia, lying
on the route between Ephesus and Rome. For in 2 Tim. iv. 11
Paul bids Timothy, &ldquo;Pick up Mark and bring him with thee,
for he is useful to me for ministering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more Mark&rsquo;s name occurs in the New Testament,
this time with yet another leader, Peter, the friend of his earliest
Christian years in Jerusalem, to whom he attached himself
after the deaths of Barnabas and Paul. Peter&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Mark,
my son,&rdquo; show how close was the spiritual tie between the
older and the younger man (1 Pet. v. 13); and as he is writing
from Rome (&ldquo;Babylon,&rdquo; since Paul&rsquo;s death and the change
of policy it implied), this forms a link between the New Testament
and early tradition, which speaks of Mark as an Evangelist
writing his Gospel under the influence of Peter&rsquo;s preaching
(in Rome). This is the essence of the tradition preserved
from &ldquo;the elders of former days&rdquo; by Clement of Alexandria
(in Eus. ii. 15, vi. 14), a tradition probably based on Papias&rsquo;s
record (cf. Eus. iii. 39) of the explanation given by &ldquo;the Elder&rdquo;
(John) as to the contrast in form between Mark&rsquo;s memoirs
of Peter&rsquo;s discourses and the Gospel of Matthew (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gospels</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Papias</a></span>), but defining the place where these memoirs were
written as Rome. That he acted to some degree as Peter&rsquo;s
interpreter or dragoman (<span class="grk" title="hermêneus">&#7953;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#962;</span>), owing to the apostle&rsquo;s
imperfect mastery of Greek, is held by some but denied by
others (<i>e.g.</i> by Zahn). His rôle throughout his career was
<i>servus servorum dei</i>; and the fact that he was this successively
to Barnabas, Paul and Peter, helps to show the essential
harmony of their message.</p>

<p>The identification of the author of the second Gospel with
Mark, which we owe to tradition, enables us to fill in our picture
of him a little further. Thus it is possible that Mark was
himself the youth (<span class="grk" title="neaniskos">&#957;&#949;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>) to whom his Gospel refers as
present at Jesus&rsquo;s arrest (xiv. 51 seq.; cf. his detailed knowledge
as to the place of the last supper, 13 seq.). It is probably as
evangelist, and not in his own person, that he became known
as &ldquo;he of the stunted extremities&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="kolobodaktulos">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#946;&#959;&#948;&#940;&#954;&#964;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, &ldquo;curt-fingered&rdquo;),
a title first found in Hippolytus (<i>Haer.</i> vii. 30),
in a context which makes its metaphorical reference to his
Gospel pretty evident.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> It was too as evangelist that he
became personally a subject of later interest, and of speculative
legends due to this, <i>e.g.</i> he was one of the Seventy (first found
in Adamantius, <i>Dial. de recta fide</i>, 4th century), he was the
founder of the Alexandrine Church (recorded as a tradition
by Eusebius, ii. 16) and its first bishop (id. ii. 2), and was
author of the local type of liturgy (cf. the <i>Acts of Mark</i>, ch. vii.,
not earlier than the end of the 4th century).</p>

<p>As to his last days and death nothing is really known. It
is possible&mdash;even probable, if we accept the theory that he
had already<a name="fa2m" id="fa2m" href="#ft2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a> been there with Barnabas&mdash;that Alexandria
was his final sphere of work, as the earliest tradition on the
point implies (the Latin <i>Prologue</i>, and Eusebius as above,
probably after Julius Africanus in the early 3rd century),
and as was widely assumed in the 4th century. That he died
and was buried there is first stated by Jerome (<i>De vir. ill.</i> 8),
to which his <i>Acts</i> adds the glory of martyrdom (cf. Ps.-Hippolytus,
<i>De LXX Apostolis</i>).</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>Medieval Legends.</i></p>

<p>The majority of medieval writers on the subject state that Mark
was a Levite; but this is probably no more than an inference from
his supposed relationship to Barnabas. The Alexandrian tradition
seems to have been that he was of Cyrenaean origin; and Severus,
a writer of the 10th century, adds to this the statement that his
father&rsquo;s name was Aristobulus, who, with his wife Mary, was driven
from the Pentapolis to Jerusalem by an invasion of barbarians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page728" id="page728"></a>728</span>
(Severus Aschimon in Renaudot, <i>Hist. patriarch. alex.</i>, p. 2). In
the apocryphal Acts of Barnabas, which profess to be written by
him, he speaks of himself as having been formerly a servant of
Cyrillus, the high priest of Zeus, and as having been baptized at
Iconium. The presbyter John, whom Papias quotes, says distinctly
that &ldquo;he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him&rdquo; (Eusebius,
<i>loc. cit.</i>); and this positive statement is fatal to the tradition, which
does not appear until about two hundred and fifty years afterwards,
that he was one of the seventy disciples (Epiphanius, pseudo-Origen
<i>De recta in Deum fide</i>, and the author of the <i>Paschal Chronicle</i>).
Various other results of the tendency to fill up blank names in the
gospel history must be set aside on the same ground; it was, for
example, believed that Mark was one of the disciples who &ldquo;went
back&rdquo; because of the &ldquo;hard saying&rdquo; (pseudo-Hippolyt., <i>De LXX
Apostolis</i> in Cod. Barocc. Migne, <i>Patrol. graec.</i> x. 955); there was
an Alexandrian tradition that he was one of the servants at the
miracle of Cana of Galilee, that he was the &ldquo;man bearing a pitcher
of water&rdquo; in whose house the last supper was prepared, and that
he was also the owner of the house in which the disciples met on
the evening of the resurrection (Renaudot, <i>loc. cit.</i>); and even in
modern times there has been the conjecture that he was the
&ldquo;certain young man&rdquo; who &ldquo;fled naked&rdquo; from Gethsemane,
Mark xiv. 51, 52 (Olshausen).</p>

<p>A tradition which was widely diffused, and which is not in itself
improbable, was that he afterwards preached the gospel and presided
over the church at Alexandria (the earliest extant testimony is that
of Eusebius, <i>H. E.</i> ii. 16, 1; ii. 24; for the fully-developed legend
of later times see Symeon Metaphrastes, <i>Vita S. Marci</i>, and Eutychius
<i>Origines ecclesiae Alexandrinae</i>). There was another, though perhaps
not incompatible, tradition that he preached the gospel and presided
over the church at Aquileia in North Italy. The earliest testimony
in favour of this tradition is the vague statement of Gregory of
Nazianzus that Mark preached in Italy, but its existence in the 7th
century is shown by the fact that in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 629 Heraclius sent the
patriarchal chair from Alexandria to Grado, to which city the
patriarchate of Aquileia had been then transferred (<i>Chron. patriarch.
Gradens.</i>, in Ughelli, <i>Italia sacra</i>, tom. v. p. 1086; for other references
to the general tradition see De Rubeis, <i>Monum. eccles. aquileien.</i>,
c. 1; <i>Acta sanctorum</i>, ad April, xxv.). It was through this tradition
that Mark became connected with Venice, whither the patriarchate
was further transferred from Grado; an early Venetian legend, which
is represented in the Cappella Zen in the basilica of St Mark, antedates
this connexion by picturing the evangelist as having been stranded
on the Rialto, while it was still an uninhabited island, and as having
had the future greatness of the city revealed to him (Danduli, <i>Chron.</i>
iv. 1, ap. Muratori, <i>Rer. ital. script.</i> xii. 14).</p>

<p>The earliest traditions appear to imply that he died a natural
death (Eusebius, Jerome, and even Isidore of Seville); but the Martyrologies
claim him as a martyr, though they do not agree as to the
manner of his martyrdom. According to the pseudo-Hippolytus
he was burned; but Symeon Metaphrastes and the <i>Paschal Chronicle</i>
represent him to have been dragged over rough stones until he died.
But, however that may be, his tomb appears to have been venerated
at Alexandria, and there was a firm belief at Venice in the middle
ages that his remains had been translated thither in the 9th century
(the fact of the translation is denied even by Tillemont; the weakness
of the evidence in support of the tradition is apparent even in Molini&rsquo;s
vigorous defence of it, lib. ii. c. 2; the minute account which the
same writer gives, lib., ii. c. 11, of the discovery of the supposed
actual bones of the evangelist in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1811, is interesting). There
was another though less widely accepted tradition, that the remains
soon after their translation to Venice were retranslated to the abbey
of Reichenau on Lake Constance; a circumstantial account of this
retranslation is given in the treatise <i>Ex miraculis S. Marci</i>, in Pertz,
<i>Mon. hist. german. script.</i>, tom. iv. p. 449. It may be added that
the Venetians prided themselves on possessing, not only the body
of St Mark, but also the autograph of his Gospel; this autograph,
however, proved on examination to be only part of a 6th-century
book of the Gospels, the remainder of which was published by
Bianchini as the <i>Evangeliarium forojuliense</i>; the Venetian part
of this MS. was found some years ago to have been wholly destroyed
by damp.</p>

<p>It has been at various times supposed that Mark wrote other
works besides the Gospel. Several books of the New Testament
have been attributed to him: viz. the Epistle to the Hebrews
(Spanheim, <i>Op. miscell.</i> ii. 240), the Epistle of Jude (cf. Holtzmann,
<i>Die synoptischen Evangelien</i>, p. 373), the Apocalypse (Hitzig, <i>Ueber
Johannes Marcus</i>, Zürich, 1843). The apocryphal <i>Acta Barnabae</i>
purport to have been written by him. There is a liturgy which bears
his name, and which exists in two forms; the one form was found in
a MS. of the 12th century in Calabria, and is, according to Renaudot,
the foundation of the three liturgies of St Basil, St Gregory Nazianzen
and St Cyril; the other is that which is used by the Maronite and
Jacobite Syrians. Both forms have been published by Renaudot,
<i>Liturg. oriental. collect</i>, i. 127, and ii. 176, and in Neale&rsquo;s <i>History
of the Holy Eastern Church</i>; but neither has any substantial claim to
belong to the ante-Nicene period of Christian literature.</p>

<p>The symbol by which Mark is designated in Christian art is usually
that of a lion. Each of the &ldquo;four living creatures&rdquo; of Ezekiel and
the Apocalypse has been attributed to each of the four evangelists
in turn; Augustine and Bede think that Mark is designated by the
&ldquo;man&rdquo;; Theophylact and others think that he is designated by
the eagle; Anastasius Sinaita makes his symbol the ox; but medieval
art acquiesced in the opinion of Jerome that he was indicated by
the lion. Most of the martyrologies and calendars assign April 25
as the day on which he should be commemorated; but the <i>Martyr.
Hieron.</i> gives the 23rd of September, and some Greek martyrologies
give the 11th of January. This unusual variation probably arises
from early differences of opinion as to whether there was one Mark
or more than one.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARK,<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> a word of which the principal meanings are in their
probable order of development,&mdash;boundary, an object set
up to indicate a boundary or position; hence a sign or token,
impression or trace. The word in O. Eng. is <i>mearc</i>, and appears
in all Teutonic languages, cf. Du. <i>merk</i>, Ger. <i>Mark</i>, boundary,
<i>marke</i>, sign, impression; Romanic languages have borrowed
the word, cf. Fr. <i>marque</i>, Ital. <i>marca</i>. Cognate forms outside
Teutonic have been found in Lat. <i>margo</i>, &ldquo;margin,&rdquo; and Pers.
<i>marz</i>, boundary. Others would refer to the Lith. <i>margas</i>,
striped, parti-coloured, and Sanskrit <i>marga</i>, trace, especially
of hunted game. In the sense of boundary, or a tract of country
on or near a boundary or frontier, &ldquo;mark&rdquo; in English usage
proper is obsolete, and &ldquo;march&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>) has established itself.
It still remains, however, to represent the German <i>mark</i>, a
tract of land held in common by a village community (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mark
System</a></span>), and also historically the name of certain principalities,
such as the mark of Brandenburg. The Italian <i>marca</i> is also
sometimes rendered by &ldquo;mark,&rdquo; as in the mark of Ancona.</p>

<p>Mark is also the name of a modern silver coin of the German
empire. This is apparently a distinct word and not of Teutonic
origin; it is found in all Teutonic and Romanic languages,
Latinized as <i>marca</i> or <i>marcus</i>. The mark was originally a
measure of weight only for gold and silver and was common
throughout western Europe and was equivalent to 8 oz. The
variations, however, throughout the middle ages were considerable
(see Du Cange, <i>Gloss. med. et infim. Lat., s.v. Marca</i>
for a full list). In England the &ldquo;mark&rdquo; was never a coin,
but a money of account only, and apparently came into use
in the 10th century through the Danes. It first was taken
as equal to 100 pennies, but after the Norman Conquest was
equal to 160 pennies (20 pennies to the oz.) = <span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> of the pound
sterling, or 13s. 4d., and therefore in Scotland 13<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span>d. English;
the mark (merk) Scots was a silver coin of this value, issued
first in 1570 and afterwards in 1663. The modern German
<i>mark</i> was adopted in 1873 as the standard of value and the
money of account. It is of the value of 6.146 grains of gold,
900 fine, and is equal to English standard gold of the value of
11.747 pence. The modern silver coin, nearly equal in value to
the English shilling, was first issued in 1875. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Numismatics</a></span>,

<p><span class="bold">MARK, GOSPEL OF ST,<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> the second of the four canonical
Gospels of the Christian Church. Till quite recent times this
Gospel, though nominally equal to the others in authority,
has unquestionably not aroused the same interest or feelings
of attachment as they have, partly from its not bearing the
name of an apostle for its author, as the first and fourth do,
partly, also, owing to the fact that the first and third, while
they include most of what is found in it, contain much additional
matter, which is of the highest value. Of late, however, it
has acquired new importance through the critical inquiries
which have led to the conclusion that the two other synoptic
Gospels are based upon it, or upon a document which is upon
the whole most truly represented in it (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gospel</a></span>), so that
it possesses the advantage of being an earlier source of information,
or at least of bringing us more fully into contact with
such a source. The significance of all that we can learn as to
the history of the composition of Mark&rsquo;s Gospel is clearly
enhanced by this consideration.</p>

the words of Christ and the narratives of His deeds which he
had heard the Apostle deliver, but he could not arrange the
matter &ldquo;in order,&rdquo; because he had not himself been a personal
follower of Jesus. This account Papias had derived, he tells
us, from an informant who had heard it repeatedly given by
&ldquo;the elder,&rdquo; a Christian of the first generation.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the work to which Papias
himself supposed this story to apply was the Gospel of Mark
virtually as we know it. The tradition in regard to this work
must have been continuous between his time and that of Irenaeus,
who (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 180) gives a similar account of its composition.
It may be noted also that the same view of the origin of the
Gospel of Mark appears to have been held by a contemporary
of Papias, Justin Martyr. In his <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i> (<i>c.</i> 106)
he cites a fact about the name of Peter from &ldquo;his Memoirs,&rdquo;
and adds also another similar fact about the name given to
the sons of Zebedee, just as they are stated in Mark iii. 16, 17,
and nowhere else so far as we know. He may well have been
ready to call the work &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s,&rdquo; though he believed that
Mark actually composed it, on the ground that the latter
recorded what the Apostle said (cf. ibid. <i>c.</i> 103).</p>

<p>But is our Gospel of Mark also to be identified with the
writing by Mark spoken of by &ldquo;the elder&rdquo; whose account had
been reported to Papias? Some confusion is here more conceivable;
while, if it is supposed that such a writing was worked
up in our second Gospel, this may seem sufficient to explain
the connexion of Mark&rsquo;s name with the latter.</p>

<p>In support of this view it is urged, though it is so much less
often now than it used to be, that the description &ldquo;not in order&rdquo;
does not fit our Gospel of Mark, the order in which is from an
historical point of view as good as, if not better than, in the
other Gospels. But from whomsoever the expression proceeds&mdash;whether
from Papias, or his informant, or &ldquo;the elder&rdquo;&mdash;we
may feel sure that considerations such as appeal to us from
our training in historical criticism are not those which suggested
it, but rather the want of agreement between this Gospel and
some standard which on altogether different grounds was
applied to it. This argument, then, for supposing that the
original writing by Mark differed widely in form and contents
from the Gospel which now bears his name appears to be without
force. The question whether the two differed to any, and if
so to what, extent can be decided only from an examination
of the Gospel itself.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Question of the Integrity of the Gospel of Mark.</i>&mdash;There
are in a good many parts of this Gospel indications that the
narrative has been derived from Simon Peter, or some one
else who was a personal follower of Jesus in the days of His
earthly ministry. It has been widely felt that the account
of the call of the first four disciples and of the events which
immediately followed (i. 15-39) at the opening of the Galilean
ministry, bears strong marks of proceeding from Simon Peter.
Other passages might be pointed out in which it is suitable
to suppose that this disciple in particular was the informant.
But we will content ourselves with noticing signs that the
reminiscences of some eyewitness are recorded. (<i>a</i>) Traits
appear which are wholly without importance, and upon which
no stress is laid in the context, but which it was natural for
a narrator who was actually present, and only for such a one
to introduce, because he remembered them as associated with
the principal events. The following are instances and others
might be cited: the mention of &ldquo;other boats,&rdquo; iv. 36; the
half-foolish remark made by Peter when in a dazed condition
at the Transfiguration, ix. 5, 6; the young man who, when
Jesus was arrested, followed, &ldquo;having a linen cloth cast about
him,&rdquo; xiv. 51, 52; the fact that Simon of Cyrene was &ldquo;coming
from the country,&rdquo; xv. 21. (<i>b</i>) There is great truth of local
colouring. The references to places and the descriptions of
natural features (the lake-shore, i. 16; ii. 13; iii. 7; the hills
near at hand, iii. 13; v. 5, 13; vi. 46; the desert places among
the hills or by the shore, i. 35, 45; vi. 31, 32) appear to be
accurate; the routes indicated in the journeys that are taken
are probable (vii. 24, 31; viii. 27; x. 17, 32, 46; xi. 1). Again,
the term &ldquo;village-towns&rdquo; (i. 38) is a remarkably appropriate
one (cf. Josephus, B. I. III. iii. 2). There would, indeed,
be an exception to the general correctness of the topography
if we were compelled to suppose that &ldquo;country of the Gerasenes&rdquo;
(which is the best reading according to existing MS.
evidence at Mark v. 1) must mean the territory of the city of
Gerasa. But it is easy to imagine that some confusion may
have arisen in the transliteration of the name into Greek, and
that the place really indicated is Khersa, near the middle of
the eastern shore of the lake. The pair of references (vi. 45, 53)
which might also be adduced as an exception, will be noticed
below. Further, the conditions of life and thought in Palestine
at the time in question are faithfully represented, Aramaic
words spoken on some important occasions are preserved
(iii. 17; v. 41; xv. 34). And, to mention a point of a different
kind, the parts played by different sections among the Jewish
people are such as might be expected. The point of view of
speakers and actors is throughout that belonging to the time
of the ministry of Jesus, not to that when the Christian Church
had come into existence. (<i>c</i>) The good order in this Gospel,
<i>i.e.</i> the natural development of the narrative, will be indicated
below. It has without good reason, as we have seen, been
supposed to show that it cannot be the record by Mark referred
to by Papias. And in reality it would be difficult to account
for this feature except on the supposition that one who had
lived through the events had been accustomed, when required
to give a comprehensive sketch of the history of the ministry
and sufferings of Jesus, to relate the facts in the main as they
happened; and that a hearer of his has to a considerable extent
reproduced them in the same order.</p>

<p>The last consideration seems to show that the general form
and structure of the Gospel, and not merely certain portions
of it, are original. In point of style, also, there is a large amount
of uniformity. The chief exceptions are that, whereas some
incidents are related in a very concise manner (<i>e.g.</i> i. 23-28,
and 40-45), there is in other cases considerable amplitude
of description (see esp. v. 1-20, 35-43 and ix. 14-27). But
Mark&rsquo;s own writing might exhibit this variety, according to
what he had been told or could remember. Moreover, a tendency
to amplitude of language may be noticed here and there
in some of the more concise narratives. Further, it would
be unreasonable to suppose that Mark, even if he relied chiefly
on what he had heard Peter teach, would refrain from using
any other sources of information which he possessed. Some
have supposed that the same Logian document in Greek which
was used by the first and third evangelists was also used by
Mark. This is highly improbable, but he may have derived
particular sayings from the Aramaic source itself of that document
by independent translation; and may also have learned
both sayings and narratives in other ways. It would seem
also that the Discourse on the Last Things in ch. xiii., differing
as it does both in its greater length and in its systematic structure
from other discourses recorded by him, must have come
to his hands in a written form. In it some genuine sayings
of Christ appear to have been worked up along with matter
taken from Jewish Apocalypses and in accordance with an
Apocalyptic model.</p>

<p>There does not, then, seem to be good reason for thinking
that the work which proceeded from the hands of Mark differed
widely in character and contents from the Gospel which now
bears his name. But there are indications that some passages
have been interpolated in it: <i>e.g.</i> in Mark iv. 10 there is some
want of fitness in the inquiry of the disciples as to the meaning
of &ldquo;the parables&rdquo; after only one has been given, and again a
want of agreement between that inquiry and the words of
Jesus at <i>v.</i> 13, &ldquo;Know ye not <i>this</i> parable, and how shall
ye know all the parables?&rdquo; We notice further that the two
parables in <i>vv.</i> 26-32 are somewhat loosely appended. It
looks as if they were insertions in the passage as it originally
stood, and that the references to parables in the plural, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page730" id="page730"></a>730</span>
with the statement at vv. 33, 34, had been introduced in order
to adapt the context to these additions. This view is confirmed
by the fact that in Luke viii. 4 seq. only one parable, that of the
sower, is given or referred to. This evangelist has probably
here followed the original form of Mark. Similarly the collection
of sayings after Mark ix. 40 (vv. 41-50) has probably been
interpolated. They are thrown together in a way unusual
with Mark, who is accustomed to place each important saying
in a setting of its own. Here again we note that they do not
appear at the corresponding point in Luke, though some of
them are given by him in other contexts. The account of the
crossing of the lake (vi. 45-53) after the feeding of the five
thousand furnishes an instance of a different kind. The difficulty
as to the position of Bethsaida, or (if <span class="grk" title="eis to peran">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#957;</span>,
&ldquo;unto the other side,&rdquo; at v. 45 is taken to refer only to the
crossing of a bay at the north-eastern corner of the lake) the
discrepancy between &ldquo;crossing&rdquo; in this sense and in that of v. 53
would be explained if the narrative (which is not in Luke)
may be held to be an interpolation by one not familiar with
the localities. Once more, the account of the feeding of the
four thousand (viii. 1-9) resembles that of the feeding of the
five thousand (vi. 35-44) closely in all respects except that
of the numbers given, about which differences might easily
arise in tradition, and it looks therefore as if it might be a
&ldquo;doublet,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> another form of the same narrative derived
through a different channel. And it is not so likely that Mark
should have mistaken it for a distinct incident as that an editor
of his Gospel should have done so. Some other instances, of
greater or less probability, might be mentioned.</p>

<p>In addition to such larger insertions, the text of the original
document seems to have undergone a certain amount of revision.
Some of the cases in which the first and third evangelist agree
against Mark in a word or clause may be best accounted for
by their both having reproduced the common source (an example
may be seen under 4 below).</p>

<p>As we have found it necessary to distinguish between the
original composition by Mark, to whom in the main the work
appears to be due, and some enlargement and alteration which
it subsequently underwent whereby it reached its present form,
these stages must be borne in mind in considering dates that
may be assigned in connexion with this Gospel. According to
Papias, Mark wrote after the death of Peter, <i>i.e.</i> after <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 64,
if we suppose, as it is usual to do, that Peter was martyred
in the massacre by Nero after the burning of Rome. It would
be natural for Mark to set himself to make his record soon
after the Apostle&rsquo;s death; and in confirmation of the view that
he did so it may be pointed out that in the form of the prophecy
in ch. xiii. of the calamities that were to come upon Jerusalem,
no details occur of a kind to suggest that it had actually taken
place. Further, Mark&rsquo;s work may very probably have been
used by Luke in its original form. On the other hand, it was
known to our first evangelist very nearly in the form in which
we have it. The chief revision of Mark would seem, then, to
have taken place between the times of the composition of
the first and third Gospels, which cannot be far removed from
one another (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Matthew, Gospel of St</a></span>). The last twelve
verses were added later still, probably early in the 2nd century,
probably to take the place of the ending which had been lost,
or which was regarded as defective. (On the evidence that
the last 12 verses are not by the same hand as the rest of the
Gospels see Westcott and Hort&rsquo;s <i>New Testament in Greek</i>, append.,
p. 29 seq. and Swete&rsquo;s <i>St Mark in loc.</i> and p. xcvi. seq. of his
introduction.)</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(3) <i>The Gospel History as represented in Mark.</i>&mdash;After a (i) prefatory
passage, i. 1-13, the Gospel deals with (ii) <i>Christ&rsquo;s ministry
in Galilee and other parts of northern Palestine</i>, i. 14-ix. 50. This
portion of the history may suitably be divided into three periods:
(<i>a</i>) <i>Early period.</i> From the opening of the work of Jesus to the first
plot to destroy Him (i. 14-iii. 6). (<i>b</i>) <i>Middle period.</i> From the
gathering of crowds from all parts and appointment of the Twelve
to the sending forth of the Twelve to extend Christ&rsquo;s work and the
alarm of Herod (iii. 7-vi. 29). (<i>c</i>) <i>Closing period.</i> From Christ&rsquo;s
withdrawal with His disciples after their return from their mission
to His final departure from Galilee (vi. 30-ix. 50). Throughout
we can trace a development as to (<i>a</i>) the stir created and the attitude
of men towards Jesus: i. 32-34, 37 (excitement at Capernaum);
38, 45 (fame spreads through a wide district); iii. 7, 8 (people from
distant parts appear in the crowds); iv. 2 seq. (the word of the Kingdom
is received in very various ways); viii. 28 (great diversity of
opinions as to the claims of Jesus); (<i>b</i>) the opposition to Him,
ii. 1-iii. 6-iii. 22 (scribes come from Jerusalem and a more heinous
charge is preferred); (<i>c</i>) the formation of a band of disciples and
the position accorded to them: i. 16-20 (four are called to follow
Him); ii. 14 (yet another); iii. 14 (He &ldquo;makes twelve&rdquo; including
those before called); vi. 7 seq (He sends them out to preach and work
cures); (<i>d</i>) the methods which he adopts: i. 21, 39-iii. 1 (preaches
in the synagogues, later more commonly by the lake-shore or on
the mountain sides; or He teaches in a house where He happens
to be); at iv. 1 seq. he adopts a new mode of address because a
sifting-process was required; from vi. 45 onwards He mainly devotes
Himself to the training of the Twelve, while seeking retirement from
the multitude; (<i>e</i>) in the districts which he visits: i. 38 (tour in the
neighbourhood of Capernaum); v. 1 (crosses to eastern shore of the
lake); vi. 6b (a tour which includes Nazareth); vi. 45 (Bethsaida);
vii. 31 (journey to Tyre and Sidon and back through Decapolis);
viii. 22, 27 (is at Bethsaida and visits neighbourhood of Caesarea
Philippi); (<i>f</i>) His self-revelation; viii. 27 seq. (first unambiguous
declaration of His Messiahship).</p>

<p>(iii) <i>The Journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, the Last Days, Passion
and Resurrection</i>, x. 1 to end. He goes first to &ldquo;the borders of
Judaea and beyond Jordan&rdquo; (Peraea), and exercises His ministry
there, x. 1-16. In connexion with the journey from this region to
Jerusalem three striking incidents are recorded, x. 17-52. The
account of the time in Jerusalem includes a series of conflicts with
opponents xi. 27-xii. 40, and the discourse on the Last Things,
xiii. The only notes of time in the Gospel occur in connexion with
the conspiracy to kill Jesus (xiv. 1) and the Last Supper (verse 12).</p>
</div>

<p>(4) <i>The Leading Ideas of St Mark</i>.&mdash;Ch. i. 1, which stands as a
title, was probably, even according to the short form of it
which is supported by MS. evidence, due to a reviser of the
original. Both Matthew and Luke show signs of having had
a somewhat different beginning before them. Nevertheless,
that title fitly describes the work. It is emphatically &ldquo;the
Gospel,&rdquo; because it sets forth the person and work of the Christ.
The evangelist is conscious of this aim. It appears not only
at great moments of the history such as the Baptism (i. 11), the
confession of Peter (viii. 29), the Transfiguration (ix. 7); nor
again merely in the prominence given to the miracles of Jesus
and in particular to the casting out of devils, but also in many
of the sayings recorded in it, as in the great series contained
in the narratives in ch. ii. 5, 10, 17, 19; and again in the
reply of Jesus to those who charged Him with being in collusion
with Satan (iii. 27). The character of the genuine disciples
of the Christ and the demands that are made of them form,
as it were, the complement to the representation of what He
Himself is, and are set forth in other striking sayings, related
along with the memorable occasions on which they were spoken:
(iii. 34, 35; viii. 34-36; ix. 23, 29, 35-37; x. 14, 15, 42-45).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARKBY, SIR WILLIAM<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> (1829-&emsp;&emsp;), English jurist,
the fourth son of the Rev. William Henry Markby, rector
of Duxford St Peter&rsquo;s, was born at Duxford, Cambridge, in
1829. He was educated at Bury St Edmunds and Merton
College, Oxford, where he took his degree in 1850. In 1856
he was called to the bar, and in 1865 he became recorder of
Buckingham. In 1866 he went to India as judge of the High
Court of Calcutta. This post he held for twelve years, and
on his retirement was appointed Reader in Indian Law at
Oxford. In 1892 he was a member of the Commission to
inquire into the administration of justice at Trinidad and
Tobago. Besides <i>Lectures on Indian Law</i>, he wrote <i>Elements
of Law considered with reference to the General Principles of
Jurisprudence</i>. The latter, being intended in the first place
for Indian students, calls attention to many difficulties in the
definition and application of legal conceptions which are usually
passed over in textbooks, and it ranks as one of the few books
on the philosophy of law which are both useful to beginners
and profitable to teachers and thinkers. In 1897 appeared
<i>The Indian Evidence Act, with Notes</i>. Sir William Markby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page731" id="page731"></a>731</span>
also contributed to the law magazines, articles on <i>Law and
Fact</i>, <i>German Jurists and Roman Law</i>, <i>Legal Fictions</i>, &amp;c.,
several of which are embodied in the later editions of the
<i>Elements</i>. He was made D.C.L. of Oxford in 1879, and
K.C.I.E. in 1889.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARKET<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (Lat. <i>mercatus</i>, trade or place of trade). This
term is used in two well-defined senses. (1) It means a definite
place where (<i>a</i>) traders who are retail sellers of a specific class
of commodity or commodities are in the habit of awaiting buyers
every day in shops or stalls; or whither (<i>b</i>) they are in the habit
of proceeding on specified days at more or less frequent regular
intervals. Covent Garden market for fruit and flowers, and
Leadenhall market for meat and poultry, are good examples
in London of the kind of institution included in class (<i>a</i>). They
are a very ancient economic phenomenon, dating from the
earliest period of the development of organized communities
of human beings, and in general characteristics have changed
little since they began to exist. Markets of the type of class
(<i>b</i>) are also of very ancient origin (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fairs</a></span>), but inasmuch
as they are constituted essentially by the presence of persons,
many of whom assemble from various places outside the place
of meeting, they were capable of a little more development
than those belonging to class (<i>a</i>), owing to increased facilities
for locomotion. The nature of an ancient market of class
(<i>a</i>), whither a citizen, say of Athens, or his chief slave, proceeded
daily to make household purchases, differs little from
the group of shops visited by the wives of the less wealthy
citizens of modern states. In many places abroad, and not
a few in England, actual markets still exist. It may be said
that the huge collections of shops, such as the various cooperative
stores, are only a revival of the old &ldquo;market-place,&rdquo;
with its shops or booths gathered round a central area, adapted
to the needs of modern big cities. (2) The term &ldquo;market&rdquo;
has come to be used in another and more general sense in modern
times. According to Jevons, a market is &ldquo;any body of persons
who are in intimate business relations, and carry on extensive
transactions in any commodity.&rdquo; He adds that &ldquo;these markets
may or may not be localized,&rdquo; and he instances the money
market as a case in which the term &ldquo;market&rdquo; denotes no
special locality. As a rule, however, most of the business
of a market is transacted at some particular place, such as
the London Stock Exchange, the Baltic, the Bourse of Paris,
the Chicago &ldquo;Wheat-pit.&rdquo; Even in the case of the London
money market, merchants still meet twice a week at the Royal
Exchange to deal in foreign bills, although a considerable part
of the dealings in these securities is arranged daily at offices
and counting-houses by personal visits or by telegraphic or
telephonic communication. The markets in any important
article are all closely interconnected. The submarine cable
has long ago made Chicago as important an influence on the
London corn market as Liverpool, or rather both London and
Liverpool affect and are simultaneously affected by Chicago
and other foreign markets. In like manner the Liverpool
cotton market is influenced by the markets in New Orleans
and other American cities separated from it widely in space.
In a minor degree the dealers in all places where a cotton market
exists affect the bigger markets to some extent. What is
true of the cotton market is also true to some extent of all
markets, though few markets are so highly organized or show
such large transactions as that for cotton. Among other
markets of the first class may be mentioned those for pig-iron,
wheat, copper, coffee, and sugar. There are many articles
the markets for which are of considerable dimensions at times,
but are of an intermittent character, such as the London Wool
Sales, which take place now in five &ldquo;series&rdquo; during the year.
Formerly the number of &ldquo;series&rdquo; was four. (For &ldquo;market
overt,&rdquo; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sale of Goods</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stolen Goods</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Characteristics of Markets</i>.&mdash;The conditions required in order
that the operations of a trading body may display the fully-developed
features of a modern market, whether for commodities
or securities, are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A large number of parties dealing.</p>

<p>(2) A large amount of the commodities or securities to be
dealt with.</p>

<p>(3) An organization by which all persons interested in the
commodity or security can rapidly communicate with one
another.</p>

<p>(4) Existence and frequent publication of statistical and other
information as to the present and probable future supply of the
commodity or security.</p>

<p>The movements which take place in prices in any market,
whether fully organized or not, depend largely on changes
of opinion among buyers and sellers. The changes
of opinion may be caused by erroneous as well
<span class="sidenote">Movements of Prices.</span>
as by correct information. They may also be
the result of wrong inferences drawn from correct information.
In markets for commodities of the first importance, such as
wheat, cotton, iron, and other articles which are dealt in daily,
the state of opinion may vary much during a few hours. The
broad characteristics of markets of this class are similar. There
is a tendency in all of them to show phenomena of annual
periodicity, due partly to the seasons, the activity of certain
months being in normal years greater in the case of any given
market than that of other months. This tendency was always
liable to be interfered with by the special forces at work in
particular years; and the great increase in the facilities of
communication between dealers by telegraph, and of transportation
of commodities between widely distant points, which
was one of the marked features of the development of the
economic organism in all actively commercial countries during
the last thirty years of the 19th century, has still further interfered
with it. Nevertheless, a tendency to annual periodicity
is still perceptible, especially in markets for produce of the
soil, the supply of which largely depends on the meteorological
conditions of the areas where they are grown on a scale sufficient
to furnish an appreciable proportion of the total produce.</p>

<p>Periodicity of another kind known as &ldquo;cyclic,&rdquo; and due
to a different set of causes, is believed to exist by many persons
<span class="sidenote">Cycles.</span>
competent to form a judgment; but although the
evidence for this view is very strong, the theory
expounding it is not yet in a sufficiently advanced state to
admit of its being regarded as established.</p>

<p><i>Phenomena of Markets</i>.&mdash;Bagehot said of the money market
that it is &ldquo;often very dull and sometimes extremely excited.&rdquo;
This classical description of the market for &ldquo;money&rdquo; applies
to a large extent to all markets.</p>

<p>Every market is at every moment tending to an equilibrium
between the quantity of commodities offered and that of commodities
desired; supposing equilibrium to have
<span class="sidenote">Tendency to Equilibrium.</span>
been attained in a given market, and that for some
appreciable period it is not disturbed, the price
for the commodity dealt in, in the market, will remain practically
unchanged during that period. Not that there will be no
transactions going on, but that the amounts offered daily will
be approximately equal to the amounts demanded daily.</p>

<p>We have briefly described the statical condition of a market;
<span class="sidenote">Disturbance of Equilibrium.</span>
we must now briefly examine its dynamics. Disturbance
may take place through a change in&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Supply, or opinion as to future probable
supply.</p>

<p>(2) Demand, or opinion as to future probable demand.</p>

<p>(3) In both simultaneously, but such a change that demand
is increased or decreased more than the supply, or vice versa.</p>

<p>A moderate disturbance caused by one of the above changes,
or a combination of them, will produce an immediate effect
on the price of the commodity, which again will tend to react
on both the supply and the demand by altering the opinions
of sellers and buyers. If no further change tending to disturb
the market takes place, the market will gradually settle down
again to a state of equilibrium. But if the disturbance has
been considerable, a relatively long time may elapse before
the market becomes quiet; and very likely the level of price
at which the new equilibrium is established will be very different
from that ruling before the disturbance set in. Further scientific
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page732" id="page732"></a>732</span>
investigation of the dynamics of a market is in any case very
difficult, and is impossible without a complete analysis of the
statical condition, such as is found at length in the textbooks
of mathematical economics; but it is possible to describe
briefly certain dynamical phenomena of markets which are of
a comparatively simple character, and are also of practical
interest.</p>

<p>Every great market is organized with a view not merely
to the purchase and sale of a commodity at once, or &ldquo;on the
spot,&rdquo; but also with a view to the future requirements
of buyers and sellers. This organization
<span class="sidenote">Future Delivery.</span>
arises naturally from the necessities of business,
since modern industry and commerce are carried on continuously,
and provision has to be made for the requirements, say,
of a spinning-mill, by arranging for the delivery of successive quantities
of cotton, wool or silk over a period of months &ldquo;ahead.&rdquo;
In the case of cotton, &ldquo;forward deliveries&rdquo; can be purchased
six or seven months in advance, and the person who undertakes
to deliver the cotton at the times stated is said in the language
of the market to &ldquo;sell forward.&rdquo; If the quantity of cotton
produced each year were always the same, no very remarkable
results would follow from this mode of doing business, except
the economy resulting to the spinner from not being compelled
to lock up part of his capital in raw material before he could
use it. But as the cotton and other crops vary considerably
from year to year, some curious consequences follow from the
practice of &ldquo;selling forward.&rdquo; The seller, of course, makes his
bargain in the belief that he will be able to &ldquo;cover&rdquo; the sale
he has made at a profit&mdash;that is, he hopes to be able to buy the
cotton he has to deliver at a lower price than he undertook to
deliver it at. If so, all is well for both parties, for the buyer
has had the advantage of having insured a supply of cotton.
But supposing something has happened to raise the price considerably,
such as a great &ldquo;shortage&rdquo; of the crop, the seller
may lose. If a great many other persons have taken the same
mistaken view of the probabilities of the market, a condition
of things may arise in which they may be &ldquo;cornered.&rdquo; (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cotton</a></span>.)</p>

<p>A &ldquo;corner&rdquo; in an exchangeable article is an abnormal
condition of the market for it, in which, owing to a serious
miscalculation of probable supply, many traders
who have made contracts to deliver at a certain
<span class="sidenote">&ldquo;Corners.&rdquo;</span>
date are unable to fulfil them. In most cases the fact that
the market is &ldquo;oversold&rdquo; becomes known some time before
the date for the completion of the contracts, and other traders
take advantage of the position to raise the price against those
who are &ldquo;short&rdquo; of the article. A corner is therefore usually
a result of the failure of a speculation for the fall. Theoretically
a trader who has undertaken to deliver 100 tons of an article,
but cannot, after every endeavour, obtain more than 90 tons,
could be made to pay his whole capital in order to be relieved
from the bargain. In practice he gets off more easily than this.
Frequently when many traders have sold largely &ldquo;forward&rdquo;
other traders deliberately try to use that position as a basis
for creating a &ldquo;corner.&rdquo; Generally, however, they only succeed
in causing great inconvenience to all parties, themselves included,
for as a rule they are only able to make the &ldquo;corner&rdquo;
effective by buying up so much of the article that when they
have compelled their opponents to pay largely to be relieved
of contracts to deliver, they are left with so big a stock of
the article that they cannot sell it except at a loss, which is
sometimes big enough to absorb the gain previously secured.
In the case of very small markets &ldquo;corners&rdquo; may be complete,
but in big markets they are never complete, something always
happening to prevent the full realization of the operators&rsquo;
plans. The idea of a &ldquo;corner&rdquo; is, however, so fascinating
to the commercial mind, especially in the United States, that
probably no year passes without an attempt at some operation
of the kind, though the conditions may in most cases prevent
any serious result.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Corners&rdquo; have what is called a &ldquo;moral&rdquo; aspect. It is
curious to note that the indignation of the &ldquo;market&rdquo; at the
disturbance to prices which results from operations of this kind
is generally directed against the speculators for the fall, while
that of the public, including trade consumers, is directed against
the operator for the rise. The operator for the fall, or &ldquo;bear,&rdquo;
is denounced for &ldquo;selling what he has not got,&rdquo; a very inaccurate
description of his action, while the &ldquo;bull&rdquo; or operator for the
rise is spoken of by a much wider circle as a heartless person who
endeavours to make a profit out of the necessities of others.
From a strict ethical standpoint there is really nothing to choose
between the two.</p>

<p><i>The Money Market</i>.&mdash;There is one market which presents
features of so peculiar a character that it is necessary to describe
it more particularly than other phenomena of the kind, and that
is the money market. The term money is here used to denote
&ldquo;money-market money&rdquo; or &ldquo;bankers&rsquo; money,&rdquo; a form of wealth
which has existed from early times, but not in great abundance
until within the last two or three hundred years. Immense
wealth has existed in certain countries at various epochs, owing
to the fertility of the soil, success in trade, or the plunder of
other communities, and all states which have been great have
at the time of their greatness possessed wealth; but the wealth
which the countries, or a few fortunate individuals belonging to
them, owned consisted largely of what is still called real property&mdash;that
is, land and buildings&mdash;and of the produce of the soil or of
mines. The balance consisted partly of merchandise of various
kinds and shipping, and to a large extent of the precious metals
in the form of coin or bullion, or of precious stones and jewelry.
Where no settled government was established no one could
become or remain very wealthy who was not in a position to
defend himself by the strong hand or allied with those who were;
and as a rule the only people who could so defend themselves
were possessors of large areas of rich land, who were able to
retain the services of those who dwelt on it either through their
personal military qualities or in virtue of habit and custom.
The inhabitants of wealthy cities were able to protect themselves
to some extent, but they nearly always found it necessary to ally
themselves with the neighbouring land-owners, whom they aided
with money in return for military support.</p>

<p>A money market in the modern sense of the word could only
exist in a rudimentary form under these conditions. There
was a sort of money market, for there was a changing rate of
interest and a whole code of law relating to it (Macleod, <i>Banking</i>,
3rd ed., p. 174) in republican Rome; but although large lending
and borrowing transactions were part of the daily life of the
Roman business world, as well as of those of the Greek cities
and of Carthage and its dependencies, none of these communities
presented the phenomena of a highly organised market. Money-lending
was also a regular practice in Egypt, Chaldea and other
ancient seats of civilization, as recent discoveries show. It was
only in comparatively recent times, however, when Europe had
formed itself into more or less organized states, with conditions
fairly favourable to the steady growth of trade and industry,
that organized money markets came into existence in places such
as Venice, Genoa, Augsburg, Basel, the Hanse towns, and various
cities in the Low Countries, Spain and Portugal, as well as in
London. The financial strength of these rudimentary money
markets was not very great, and as it depended a good deal on
the possession by individuals of actual cash, the existence of these
markets was precarious. &ldquo;Hoarded ducats&rdquo; were too often
an attraction to needy princes, whose unwelcome attentions a
rich merchant, even when an influential burgher of a powerful
city, was less able to resist than the violence of a housebreaker,
against whom strong vaults and well-secured chests situated in
defensible mansions were a good protection. The necessitous
potentate could often urge his desire for a &ldquo;loan&rdquo; by very
persuasive methods. Occasionally, if his predecessors had acquired
the confidence of the banking class sufficiently to induce
them to place their cash reserves in one of his strong places &ldquo;for
safety&rdquo; an unscrupulous ruler could help himself, as Charles II.
helped himself to the stores of the London goldsmiths which were
left in the Mint. The power of the banking class continued to
grow, however, and a real market for money had come into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page733" id="page733"></a>733</span>
existence in many cities of Europe by the middle of the 17th
century. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Banks and Banking</a></span>.)</p>

<p>In the 18th century the &ldquo;money market&rdquo; consisted of the
Bank of England and various banks and merchants, and distinction
between the two being still not complete. Towards
the end of that century arose an important class of dealers in
credit, the bill brokers, and with their appearance the modern
money market of London may be said to have assumed its present
<span class="sidenote">The Early Money Market.</span>
form, for though the process of development has
not ceased, the changes have been of the nature
of growth and not of the acquisition of new organs.
The formation of joint-stock banks and discount
companies, however, and the reconstitution of the Bank of
England by the Act of 1844, exercised an important influence
on the way in which the money market of London has developed.
It must be explained that in the every-day talk of the City &ldquo;the
market&rdquo; has a special meaning, by which only the banks and
discount houses, or even only the latter in some cases, are denoted,
as in the phrases constantly seen in the daily reports published
in the newspapers towards the end of a quarter, &ldquo;the market
has to-day borrowed largely from the Bank of England,&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;the market was obliged to renew part of the loans which fell
<span class="sidenote">The Modern Money Market of London.</span>
due to the Bank to-day.&rdquo; But this use of the term in a special
sense, thoroughly understood by those to whom it is habitual,
and resulting in no ambiguity in practice, is not in
accord with the requirements of economic analysis.</p>

<p>The working organs of the money market of
London at the beginning of the 20th century were:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" style="clear: both;" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">A.</td> <td class="tcl">(1) The Bank of England.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcl">(2) Banks, joint-stock and private, including several great foreign banks.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcl">(3) Discount houses and bill-brokers.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">B.</td> <td class="tcl">(4) Certain members of the Stock Exchange.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcl">&nbsp;</td> <td class="tcl">(5) Certain great merchants and finance houses.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">The institutions included in group A are the most constantly
active organs of the money market; those included in group B
are intermittently active, but in the case of section (4), though
their activity is greater at some times than others, they are
never wholly outside the market. Even in the case of (5) a
certain amount of qualification is needed, which is indicated by
the fact that most of the great merchant houses are &ldquo;registered&rdquo;
as bankers, though they do not perform the functions usually
associated with that term in the United Kingdom. Several of the
great houses were originally and still are nominally merchants,
but are largely concerned with finance business&mdash;that is, with
the making of loans to foreign governments and the issue of
capital on behalf of companies. These powerful capitalists often
have large amounts of money temporarily in their hands, and
lend it in the money market or on the Stock Exchange; one or two
of them are large buyers of bills from time to time, and generally
the members of this group may be said to be in sufficiently close
touch with the active organs of the money market to form part
of it.</p>

<p>The actual working of the money market has been described
by Walter Bagehot in his <i>Lombard Street</i>, a work which has
attained the rank of a classic. Most of what he said
in 1873 is true now, but in certain minor respects
<span class="sidenote">The Working of the Money Market.</span>
developments have taken place, the most important
being the greater extent to which money is &ldquo;used up&rdquo;
every day, or rather every night. In Bagehot&rsquo;s time the discount
houses only quoted &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; rates for &ldquo;loans at call and
short notice,&rdquo; based on the rate &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; by the banks for
loans at seven days&rsquo; notice; but since then the bill-brokers have
been obliged&mdash;(1) occasionally to fix their terms independently
of the banks, and (2) to &ldquo;allow&rdquo; a rate for &ldquo;money for the
night.&rdquo; This latter practice became usual about 1888 or 1889.
The change it introduced was not a vital one, but has some
importance from the point of view of the historian. A good
deal of the &ldquo;money&rdquo; thus dealt with is derived from the group
of traders included in class (5). It is (<i>a</i>) money which is temporarily
in the hands of houses or institutions which have just
received subscriptions to loans or other capital offered to the
public; (<i>b</i>) balances left temporarily with finance houses or
banks on behalf of foreign governments or other parties who have
payments to make in London. In the former case the &ldquo;money&rdquo;
is almost invariably only available for a short time, probably
only for a few days; in the latter case also it probably will be
only available for a few days, but <i>may</i> be available for months.
Money derived from either of these sources is usually to be had
cheap, but is not, in the slang of the City, &ldquo;good,&rdquo; because it is
uncertain how long loans at call obtained from either of
them will remain undisturbed. Nevertheless, there has been at
times so much &ldquo;money&rdquo; of this fugitive character, and derived
from such varied sources since about 1888, that its cheapness
has been an attraction to the less wealthy bill-brokers, who have
occasionally been able to go on using it profitably for many
continuous weeks, or even months, in their business. The risk
run by employing it is, of course, the certainty that it will be
&ldquo;called&rdquo; from the borrower sooner or later, and probably at a
time when it is very inconvenient to repay it. The more wealthy
houses take money of this kind when it suits them, but never rely
on it as a basis for business.</p>

<p>Since Bagehot wrote the growth of the big joint-stock banks
has been enormous, not so much through the increased business
done by banks generally, though the expansion in
banking has been considerable, as by the absorption
<span class="sidenote">The Great Banks.</span>
of a great number of small banks by three or four
large institutions (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Banks and Banking</a></span>). The growth of
these large institutions tends to facilitate combination for
purposes of common concern among banks generally&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> to
support the Bank of England in maintaining its reserve, which
is the sole reserve of all the banks, at a proper level, and thus
render the money market more stable. Two or three of the
banks have for a long time, owing to their large holding of bills,
had much more influence than the Bank of England over the
foreign exchanges, on which the foreign bullion movements
chiefly depend; and since 1890 persons of weight in the joint-stock
banking body have implicitly, though not explicitly,
admitted a certain degree of responsibility in the matter on behalf
of their institutions. It is, however, characteristic of British
business arrangements that the question of the responsibility
for the reserve of the Bank of England, the ultimate reserve of the
whole country, is still in as nebulous a condition, so far as explicit
acceptance of responsibility by any institution is concerned, as
it was in 1870. There has been no improvement in theory,
though in practice there has been real improvement, since
Bagehot&rsquo;s time. The tendency is, indeed, decidedly in the direction
of closer combination between the Bank and the banks.
On more than one occasion the Bank has, not merely by borrowing
&ldquo;in the market,&rdquo; but by more or less private negotiations
with the big banks, obtained temporary control of large sums
belonging to the banks in order to take cash off the market.
This proceeding, and its concomitants, did not meet with universal
approval; but the results were satisfactory on the whole,
and on the later occasions when the measure was carried out
there was little or no friction.</p>

<p>The enormous war loans raised by Japan in 1904, 1905, 1906
exemplified aptly the more modern methods of dealing with the
disturbance to the money market which such operations
produce. The loans were issued by three
<span class="sidenote">Effect of Big Foreign Loans.</span>
banks, one of which was a Japanese institution and
represented the Japanese government in the operations
connected with the various loans. Of the other two, one
was a leading London bank and the other the principal British
bank doing business in China. These large loans were issued
with the minimum of disturbance to the London money market.
The very large amounts of cash which were suddenly withdrawn
from other banks, and deposited with the institutions issuing the
loan as &ldquo;application money,&rdquo; were lent out again in the short
loan market as soon as possible, usually on the afternoon of the
day of issue. The work involved was very heavy, as a great
number of cheques had to be cleared in a brief space of time, but
by skilful organization this was done. Similar promptitude
was displayed when the successive instalments on the loans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page734" id="page734"></a>734</span>
became due and were paid, most of the cash being available
for borrowers a few hours after it was paid in by the holders of
the scrip which represented the loans until the definitive bonds
were ready. The task of dealing with cash forming instalments
of the loans was not, however, the only problem before the banks
which issued them. As the scrip of each loan gradually became
&ldquo;fully paid&rdquo; the proceeds of the loan in the hands of the banks
became a very large sum. The Japanese government held the
whole of it at its disposal, and might have seriously embarrassed
the London money market if it had not dealt with its
huge balances considerately. The Japanese government had
promised not to withdraw any portion of the loans raised in
London in gold, but it was under no restrictions as to how it
should employ the money lying to its account. It might have
kept it locked up until it had a bill for ships or clothing to pay.
As might be expected, the government from the outset transferred
a portion of what was deposited with the banks to the
Bank of England, finding it advantageous on various grounds
to do so. The remainder was lent for short periods by the banks,
but for some time no means were available for lending for any
considerable length of time, though the Japanese government
had no immediate use for the whole of it. It was suggested to
the government by its advisers that it would be a convenience
to the money market, and no inconvenience to Japanese policy,
if any balances which were not likely to be wanted for some
months were invested in British treasury bills, and the government,
after fully acquainting itself with the nature of the operation,
agreed to it. The plan was found to work well; it released
for definite periods money that would otherwise have been of
little use to the money market, and it was of pecuniary benefit
to the Japanese exchequer to the extent of the interest earned
by the portion of the balances so employed. Incidentally it
suited the British treasury; the Japanese demand, which became
a constant feature in connexion with treasury bill issues, lowered
the discount rates at which &ldquo;sixes&rdquo; were placed. The Japanese
not only applied for treasury bills and bought them in the market,
but they also took up some of the exchequer bonds issued in
connexion with the South African war towards the end of their
currency, thus relieving the money market of a further part of
the weight of British government paper which it would otherwise
have had to take on itself. A further important development
of Japanese management of its London balances took place in
1906, when a portion of these balances was placed under the
control of agents of the Bank of England, to be lent, or not lent,
in the market as suited the Bank&rsquo;s policy, which was at that
time directed to raising the value of money in order to protect
and increase its reserve. The plan worked very well on the whole.
It was merely an adaptation of a practice initiated some years
before, whereby the Bank sometimes obtained temporary control
of moneys belonging to the India Council. The same idea, that
of &ldquo;intercepting&rdquo; market funds, which were beating down the
discount rate, depressing the foreign exchanges and depleting
the Bank&rsquo;s reserve, has been employed in regard to the clearing
banks themselves, the banks having on more than one occasion
agreed to lend the Bank of England a certain portion of their
balances.</p>

<p>The discount houses, though an important body of institutions,
are not of so much importance as they were before 1866, when
they suffered a serious blow through the failure of
&ldquo;Overend&rsquo;s,&rdquo; from which as a body they have never
<span class="sidenote">The Discount Houses.</span>
fully recovered. The five large concerns which still
exist are, however, very powerful and exercise considerable
influence on the market. They hold considerable
quantities of bills at all times; occasionally their holdings are
very large, but they turn out the contents of their bill cases
readily if they think fit. Their business is different in practice
from that of the smaller &ldquo;bill-brokers,&rdquo; who usually are what
their name suggests, namely, persons who do not hold many
bills, but find them for banks who need them, charging a small
commission. The small bill-brokers borrow from the Bank of
England much more freely than the big discount houses. The
latter only &ldquo;go to the bank&rdquo; in ordinary times perhaps once or
twice a year. During the South African War, which disturbed
the money market very much, they obtained accommodation
from the Bank more frequently than usual. The small brokers
almost always have to borrow from the Bank at the end of
every quarter, when money is scarce owing to the regular
quarterly requirements of business, and also, to some extent,
because certain of the banks make it a practice to call in loans
at the end of each month in order to show a satisfactory cash
reserve in their monthly balance-sheet. This practice is not
approved by the best authorities, for although it does no great
harm in quiet times, the banks who follow it might find it
difficult, or even impossible, to call in their loans in times of
severe stringency.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARKHAM, SIR CLEMENTS ROBERT<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> (1830-&emsp;&emsp;), English
traveller, geographer and author, son of the Rev. David F. Markham,
canon of Windsor, and of Catherine, daughter of Sir W.
Milner, Bart., of Nunappleton, Yorkshire, was born on the 20th
of July 1830 at Stillingfleet, near York, and educated at Westminster
School. He entered the navy in 1844, became midshipman
in 1846, and passed for a lieutenant in 1851. In 1850-1851
he served on the Franklin search expedition in the Arctic regions,
under Captain Austin. He retired from the navy in 1852, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page735" id="page735"></a>735</span>
1852-1854 travelled in Peru and the forests of the eastern Andes.
He visited South America again in 1860-1861, in order to arrange
for the introduction of the cinchona plant into India, a service
of the highest value to humanity. In 1865-1866 he visited
Ceylon and India, to inspect and report upon the Tinnevelly
pearl-fishery and the cinchona plantations. On the Abyssinian
expedition of 1867-68 he served as geographer, and
was present at the storming of Magdala. In 1874 he
accompanied the Arctic expedition under Sir George Nares
as far as Greenland. In later years Sir Clements Markham
travelled extensively in western Asia and the United States.
In 1855 he became a clerk in the Board of Control. From
1867-1877 he was in charge of the geographical department
of the Indian Office. He was secretary to the Hakluyt

From 1863-1888 he acted as secretary to the Royal Geographical
Society, and on his retirement received the society&rsquo;s
gold medal for his distinguished services to geography. He
was elected president of the same society in 1893, and retained
office for the unprecedented period of twelve years, taking an
active share in the work of the society and in increasing its usefulness
in various directions. It was almost entirely due to his
exertions that funds were obtained for the National Antarctic
Expedition under Captain Robert Scott, which left England in
the summer of 1901. Sir Clements Markham was elected F.R.S.
in 1873; was created C.B. in 1871, and K.C.B. in 1896; became
an honorary member of the principal geographical societies;
and was president of the International Geographical Congress
which met in London in 1895.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARKHAM, GERVASE<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Jervis</span>) (1568?-1637), English
poet and miscellaneous writer, third son of Sir Robert Markham
of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, was born probably in 1568. He
was a soldier of fortune in the Low Countries, and later was a
captain under the earl of Essex&rsquo;s command in Ireland. He was
acquainted with Latin and several modern languages, and had
an exhaustive practical acquaintance with the arts of forestry
and agriculture. He was a noted horse-breeder, and is said
to have imported the first Arab. Very little is known of the
events of his life. The story of the murderous quarrel between
Gervase Markham and Sir John Holles related in the <i>Biographia
Britannica</i> (<i>s.v.</i> Holles) has been generally connected with him,
but in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, Sir Clements R.
Markham, a descendant from the same family, refers it to another
contemporary of the same name, whose monument is still to be
seen in Laneham church. Gervase Markham was buried at
St Giles&rsquo;s, Cripplegate, London, on the 3rd of February 1637.
He was a voluminous writer on many subjects, but he repeated
himself considerably in his works, sometimes reprinting the same
books under other titles. His booksellers procured a declaration
from him in 1617 that he would produce no more on certain topics.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Markham&rsquo;s writings include: <i>The Teares of the Beloved</i> (1600)
and <i>Marie Magdalene&rsquo;s Teares</i> (1601) long and rather commonplace
poems on the Passion and Resurrection of Christ, both reprinted
by Dr A. B. Grosart in the <i>Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies Library</i>
(1871); <i>The most Honorable Tragedy of Sir Richard Grinvile</i> (1595),
reprinted (1871) by Professor E. Arber, a prolix and euphuistic poem
in eight-lined stanzas which was no doubt in Tennyson&rsquo;s mind when
he wrote his stirring ballad; <i>The Poem of Poems, or Syon&rsquo;s Muse</i>
(1595), dedicated to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Philip Sidney;
<i>Devoreux, Vertues Teares</i> (1597). <i>Herod and Antipater, a Tragedy</i>
(1622) was written in conjunction with William Sampson, and with
Henry Machin he wrote a comedy called <i>The Dumbe Knight</i> (1608).
<i>A Discourse of Horsemanshippe</i> (1593) was followed by other popular
treatises on horsemanship and farriery. <i>Honour in his Perfection</i>
(1624) is in praise of the earls of Oxford, Southampton and Essex,
and the <i>Souldier&rsquo;s Accidence</i> (1625) turns his military experiences
to account. He edited Juliana Berners&rsquo;s <i>Boke of Saint Albans</i>
under the title of <i>The Gentleman&rsquo;s Academie</i> (1595), and produced
numerous books on husbandry, many of which are catalogued in
Lowndes&rsquo;s <i>Bibliographer&rsquo;s Manual</i> (Bohn&rsquo;s ed., 1857-1864).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARKHAM, MRS,<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> the pseudonym of Elizabeth Penrose
(1780-1837), English writer, daughter of Edmund Cartwright,
the inventor of the power-loom. She was born at her father&rsquo;s
rectory at Goadby Marwood, Leicestershire, on the 3rd of August
1780. In 1804 she married the Rev. John Penrose, a country
clergyman in Lincolnshire and a voluminous theological writer.
During her girlhood Mrs Penrose had frequently stayed with
relatives at Markham, a village in Nottinghamshire, and from
this place she took the <i>nom de plume</i> of &ldquo;Mrs Markham,&rdquo; under
which she gained celebrity as a writer of history and other books
for the young. The best known of her books was <i>A History of
England from the First Invasion by the Romans to the End of the
Reign of George III.</i> (1823), which went through numerous
editions. In 1828 she published a <i>History of France</i>. Both
these works enjoyed a wide popularity in America as well as in
England. The distinctive characteristic of &ldquo;Mrs Markham&rsquo;s&rdquo;
histories was the elimination of all the &ldquo;horrors&rdquo; of history,
and of the complications of modern party politics, as being unsuitable
for the youthful mind; and the addition to each chapter
of &ldquo;Conversations&rdquo; between a fictitious group consisting of
teacher and pupils bearing upon the subject matter. Her less
well-known works were <i>Amusements of Westernheath, or Moral
Stories for Children</i> (2 vols., 1824); <i>A Visit to the Zoological
Gardens</i> (1829); two volumes of stories entitled <i>The New Children&rsquo;s
Friend</i> (1832); <i>Historical Conversations for Young People</i>
(1836); <i>Sermons for Children</i> (1837). Mrs Markham died at
Lincoln on the 24th of January 1837.</p>

of his old school and college in 1753 and 1767 respectively.
He held from time to time a number of livings, and in 1771 was

In 1777 he became archbishop of York, and also lord high
almoner and privy councillor. He was for some time a close
friend of Edmund Burke, but his strong championship of Warren
Hastings caused a breach. He was accused by Lord Chatham of
preaching pernicious doctrines, and was a victim of the Gordon
riots in 1780. He died in 1807.</p>

The main industries of the place are, however, weaving and
dyeing, and it is estimated that there are about 40,000 work-people
in the industrial district of which Markirch is the centre.
The small river Leber, which intersects the town, was at one
time the boundary between the German and French languages,
and traces of this separation still exist. The German-speaking
inhabitants on the right bank were Protestants, and subject to
the counts of Rappoltstein, while the French inhabitants were
Roman Catholics, and under the rule of the dukes of Lorraine.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARKO KRALYEVICH,<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> Servian hero, was a son of the
Servian king or prince, Vukashin (d. 1371). Chagrined at not
himself becoming king after his father&rsquo;s death, he headed a revolt
against the new ruler of the Servians. Later he passed into the
service of the sultan of Turkey, and was killed in battle about
1394. Marko, however, is more celebrated in legend than in
history. He is regarded as the personification of the Servian
race, and stories of strength and wonder have gathered round his
name. He is supposed to have lived for 300 years, to have
ridden a horse 150 years old, and to have used his enormous
physical strength against oppressors, especially against the
Turks. He is a great figure in Servian poetry, and his deeds are
also told in the epic poems of the Rumanians and the Bulgarians.
One tradition relates how he retired from the world owing to the
advent of firearms, which, he held, made strength and valour
of no account in battle. Goethe regards Marko as the counterpart
of Hercules and of the Persian Rustem.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARK SYSTEM,<a name="ar162" id="ar162"></a></span> the name given to a social organization which
rests on the common tenure and common cultivation of the land
by small groups of freemen. Both politically and economically
the mark was an independent community, and its earliest
members were doubtless blood relatives. In its origin the word
is the same as mark or march (<i>q.v.</i>), a boundary. First used in
this sense, it was then applied to the land cleared by the settlers
in the forest areas of Germany, and later it was used for the system
which prevailed&mdash;to what extent or for how long is uncertain&mdash;in
that country. It is generally assumed that the lands of the
mark were divided into three portions, forest, meadow and arable,
and as in the manorial system which was later in vogue elsewhere,
a system of rotation of crops in two, three or even six fields was
adopted, each member of the community having rights of pasture
in the forest and the meadow, and a certain share of the arable.
The mark was a self-governing community. Its affairs were
ordered by the markmen who met together at stated times in
the markmoot. Soon, however, their freedom was encroached
upon, and in the course of a very short time it disappeared
altogether.</p>

<p>The extent and nature of the mark system has been, and still
is, a subject of controversy among historians. One school
holds that it was almost universal in Germany; that it was, in
fact, the typical Teutonic method of holding and cultivating
the land. From Germany, it is argued, it was introduced by
the Angle and Saxon invaders into England, where it was
extensively adopted, being the foundation upon which the prevailing
land system in early England was built. An opposing
school denies entirely the existence of the mark system, and a
French writer, Fustel de Coulanges, refers to it contemptuously
as &ldquo;a figment of the Teutonic imagination.&rdquo; This view is based
largely upon the supposition that common ownership of the land
was practically unknown among the early Germans, and was
by no means general among the early English. The truth will
doubtless be found to lie somewhere between the two extremes.
The complete mark system was certainly not prevalent in
Anglo-Saxon England, nor did it exist very widely, or for any
very long period in Germany, but the system which did prevail
in these two countries contained elements which are also found
in the mark system.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief authority on the mark system is G. L. von Maurer, who
has written <i>Einleitung zur Geschichte der Mark- Hof- Dorf- und
Stadtverfassung und der öffentlichen Gewalt</i> (Munich, 1854; new ed.,
Vienna, 1896), and <i>Geschichte der Markenverfassung in Deutschland</i>
(Erlangen, 1856). See also N. D. Fustel de Coulanges, <i>Recherches sur
quelques problèmes de l&rsquo;histoire</i> (1885); and a translation from
the same writer&rsquo;s works called <i>The Origin of Property in Land</i>, by
M. Ashley. This contains an introductory chapter by Professor
W. J. Ashley. Other authorities are K. Lamprecht, <i>Deutsches Wirtschaftsleben
im Mittelalter</i> (Leipzig, 1886); R. Schröder, <i>Lehrbuch

<p><span class="bold">MARL<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> (from O. Fr. <i>marle</i>, Late Lat. <i>margila</i>, dim. of <i>marga</i>;
cf. Du. and Ger. <i>Mergel</i>), a calcareous clay, or a mixture of
carbonate of lime with argillaceous matter. It is impossible
to give a strict definition of a marl, for the term is applied to a
great variety of rocks and soils with a considerable range of
composition. On the one hand, the marls graduate into clays
by diminution in the amount of lime that they contain, and on
the other hand they pass into argillaceous limestones (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Limestone</a></span>).
From 25-75% of carbonate of lime may be regarded
as characteristic of the marls. But in popular usage many
substances are called marls which would not be included under
the definition given here. The practice formerly much in
vogue of top-dressing land with marls, and the use of many
different kinds of earth and clay for that purpose, has led to
a very general misapplication of the term; for all sorts of rotted
rock, some being of igneous origin while others are rain-wash,
loams, and various superficial deposits, have been called &ldquo;marls&rdquo;
in different parts of Britain, if only it was believed that an
application of them to the surface of the fields would result in
increased fertility.</p>

<p>The typical marls are soft, earthy, and of a white, grey or
brownish colour. Many of them disintegrate in water; and they
are readily attacked by dilute hydrochloric acid, which dissolves
the carbonate of lime rapidly, giving off bubbles of carbon
dioxide. The lime of some marls is present in the form of shells,
whole or broken; in others it is a fine impalpable powder mixed
with the clay. In many marls there is organic matter (plant
fragments or humus). Sand is usually not abundant but is
rarely absent. Gypsum occurs in some marls, occasionally
in large simple crystals with the form of lozenge-shaped plates
or in twinned groups resembling an arrow-head; fine examples of
these are obtained in the marls of Montmartre near Paris, where
celestine (strontium sulphate) occurs also in nodular or concretionary
masses. Large crystals of calcite or of dolomite, lumps
of iron pyrites or radiate nodules of marcasite, and small crystals
of quartz are found in certain marl deposits; and in Westphalia
the marls of the Senonian (part of the Cretaceous system) at
Hamm yield masses of strontianite up to two feet in length. A
very large variety of accessory minerals may be proved to exist in
marls by microscopic examination.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The rocks known as shell marls are found in many parts of Britain
and other northern countries, and are much valued by farmers as
a source of carbonate of lime, though rarely burned to produce
quicklime. They are generally obtained by digging pits in marshy
spots or meadows, and often occur below considerable thicknesses
of peat. Large numbers of shells of fresh-water mollusca are scattered
through a matrix of clay; usually retaining their shapes though they
are in a friable and semi-decomposed state. The species represented
are very few, and from their unbroken state it is obvious that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page737" id="page737"></a>737</span>
have not been transported but lived in the place where their remains
are found. As mollusca of this kind thrive best in open stretches
of clear water, the sites of the marl deposits must have been shallow
lakes and open pools.</p>

<p>Among the older strata it is not uncommon to find beds which
have the same composition and in many cases the same origin as
shell marl. While some of them are fresh-water deposits, others
are of marine origin. The &ldquo;crag beds&rdquo; of the Pliocene formation
in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex are essentially sand and gravel, which
are often rich in shells; with them occur clays such as the Chillesford
clay; and many of these beds have actually been used as marls for
dressing the surface of agricultural land. Better examples occur
among the Oligocene beds of the Hampshire basin and the Isle of
Wight, where the Steadon, Bembridge and Hempstead marls are
clays, more or less sandy, containing fresh-water shells. In the
Cretaceous rocks of the south of England soft argillaceous limestones
of marine origin, which may be described as marls, occur on several
horizons. At its base the white chalk is often mixed with clay, and
the &ldquo;chalk marl&rdquo; is a rock of this kind; it is known in Cambridgeshire,
at Folkestone, in the Isle of Wight, &amp;c. The chloritic marl,
which underlies the chalk and is well developed in the Isle of Wight,
is a greenish argillaceous limestone, the colour being due to the
presence of glauconite, not of chlorite; it is often very fossiliferous.
The Gault, an argillaceous type of the Upper Greensand, is a stiff
greyish calcareous clay, beneath the white chalk, well known for the
excellent preservation of its fossils. It outcrops along the base of
the escarpment of the North and South Downs; the original name
given to it by William Smith was &ldquo;the blue marl.&rdquo; In the Jurassic
rocks of England there are marls or shelly fresh-water clays in the
Purbeck series and also in the estuarine beds of the Great Oolite,
but the name &ldquo;marlstone&rdquo; has long been reserved for the argillaceous
limestone of the Middle Lias. It ranges from the Dorset coast,
through Edge Hill in Warwickshire and Lincolnshire, and thence
to the sea in the north of Yorkshire, presenting many variations
in this long extent of country and often accompanied by, or converted
into, beds of clay ironstone. The marlstone is typically a
firm, greyish limestone weathering to a rusty brown colour, and is
always more or less argillaceous.</p>

<p>In the Triassic rocks of Britain there is a very important series
of red, green and mottled clays, over a thousand feet thick in some
places, which have been called the New Red marls. They belong
to the Keuper or uppermost division of the system, and in Cheshire
contain valuable deposits of rock salt, the principal sources of that
mineral in Great Britain. In the strict sense these rocks are not
marls, being ferruginous clays rather than calcareous clays. Most
of them appear to have been laid down in saline lakes in desert
regions. As a rule they contain very few fossils, and often they
have little or no carbonate of lime, but beds and veins of fibrous
gypsum occur in them in considerable profusion. These rocks cover
a wide area in the midland counties extending to the south coast
near Exmouth, and reappear in the north in the Vale of Eden and
a few places in southern Scotland. The clays are used for brick-making,
and yield a stiff soil, mostly devoted to pasture and dairy
farming. In the Rhaetic beds which immediately overlie the
Triassic rocks there are three seams of calcareous clay, often only
a few feet thick, which have been called the &ldquo;grey marls&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;tea-green marls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To rocks older than these the name marl has not often been given,
probably because, though argillaceous limestones are often common
in the Carboniferous and Silurian rocks, they are usually firm and
compact, while marls usually comprise rocks which are more or less
soft and friable. In other countries, and especially in Germany,
many different kinds of marl and of marl-slate are described. Two
of these are of especial importance&mdash;the dark copper-bearing marl
slate of the Permian rocks near Mansfeld in Germany, which has
been long and extensively worked as sources of copper, and the white
or creamy Solenhofen limestone, much quarried in Bavaria, and
used as a lithographic stone.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARLBOROUGH, EARLS AND DUKES OF.<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> The earldom
of Marlborough was held by the family of Ley from 1626 to 1679.
James Ley, the 1st earl (<i>c.</i> 1550-1629), was lord chief justice of
the King&rsquo;s Bench in Ireland and then in England; he was an
English member of parliament and was lord high treasurer from
1624 to 1628. In 1624 he was created Baron Ley and in 1626
earl of Marlborough. The 3rd earl was his grandson James
(1618-1665), a naval officer who was killed in action with the
Dutch. James was succeeded by his uncle William, a younger
son of the 1st earl, on whose death in 1679 the earldom became
extinct.</p>

<p>In 1689 John Churchill was created earl and in 1702 duke of
Marlborough (see below). After the death of his only son Charles
in 1703 an act of parliament was passed in 1706 settling the duke&rsquo;s
titles upon his daughters and their issue. Consequently when he
died in June 1722 his eldest daughter Henrietta (1681-1733),
wife of Francis Godolphin, 2nd earl of Godolphin, became duchess
of Marlborough. She died without sons and was succeeded by
her nephew Charles Spencer, 5th earl of Sunderland (1706-1758),
a son of the great duke&rsquo;s second daughter Anne (d. 1716). Although
at this time Charles handed over the Sunderland estates
to his younger brother John, the ancestor of the earls Spencer,
he did not obtain Blenheim until Sarah, the dowager duchess,
died in 1744. His eldest son George Spencer, the 4th duke (1739-1817),
left three sons. The eldest, George Spencer, the 5th
duke (1766-1840), was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron
Spencer of Wormleighton in 1806, and in 1817, after succeeding
to the dukedom, he took the name of Spencer-Churchill. The 4th
duke&rsquo;s second son was Lord Henry John Spencer (1770-1795),
envoy to Sweden and to Prussia; and his third son was Lord
Francis Almeric Spencer (1779-1845), who was created a peer
as Baron Churchill of Whichwood in 1815. His grandson
Victor Albert Francis Charles Spencer (b. 1864) succeeded his
father as 3rd Baron Churchill in 1886, and was raised to the
rank of a viscount in 1902.</p>

<p>The 7th duke of Marlborough, John Winston Spencer-Churchill
(1822-1883), a prominent Conservative politician, was lord-lieutenant
of Ireland 1876-1880, and when marquess of
Blandford (the courtesy title borne by the duke&rsquo;s eldest son in
his father&rsquo;s lifetime) was responsible for the act of 1856 called
the &ldquo;Blandford Act,&rdquo; enabling populous parishes to be divided
for purposes of Church work. In 1892 his grandson Charles
Richard John Spencer-Churchill (b. 1871) became 9th duke of
Marlborough.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARLBOROUGH, JOHN CHURCHILL,<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Duke of</span> (1650-1722),
English soldier, was born in the small manor house of Ash,
in Musbury, Devonshire, near Axminster, in May or June 1650.
Arabella Churchill, his eldest sister, and the mother of the
duke of Berwick, was born in the same house on the 28th of
February 1648. They were the children of Winston Churchill
of Glanville Wotton in Dorset and Elizabeth the fourth daughter
of Sir John Drake, who died in 1636; his widow, after the close
of the civil war, received her son-in-law into her own house.
From 1663 to 1665 John Churchill went to St Paul&rsquo;s school, and
there is a tradition that during this period he showed the bent
of his taste by reading and re-reading Vegetius <i>De re militari</i>.
When fifteen years old he became page of honour to the duke of
York, and about the same time his sister Arabella became maid
of honour to the duchess, two events which contributed greatly
to the advancement of the Churchills. On the 14th of September
1667 he received through the influence of his master a commission
in the Guards, and left England for service at Tangier but returned
home in the winter of 1670-1671. For a short interval Churchill
remained in attendance at the court, and it was during this
period that the natural carefulness of his disposition was shown
by his investing in an annuity a present of £5,000 given him by
the duchess of Cleveland.</p>

<p>In June 1672, when England to her shame sent six thousand
troops to aid Louis XIV. in his attempt to subdue the Dutch,
Churchill was made a captain in the company of which the duke
of York was colonel, and soon attracted the attention of Turenne,
by whose profound military genius the whole army was directed.
At the siege of Nimeguen Churchill acquitted himself with such
success that the French commander predicted his ultimate rise
to distinction. When Maestricht was besieged in June 1673 he
saved the life of the duke of Monmouth, and received the thanks
of Louis XIV. for his services. In 1678 he was married to
Sarah Jennings (b. June 5, 1660), the favourite attendant on
the Princess Anne, younger daughter of the duke of York. Her
father, Richard Jennings of Sandridge, near St Albans, had
twenty-two brothers and sisters; one of the latter married a
London tradesman named Francis Hill, and their daughter
Abigail Hill afterwards succeeded her cousin the duchess of
Marlborough as favourite to Queen Anne.</p>

<p>On the accession of James II. the Churchills received a great
increase in fortune. Colonel Churchill had been created a
Scotch peer as Lord Churchill of Eyemouth on the 21st of
December 1682; and as a reward for his services in going on a
special mission from the new monarch to Louis XIV. he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page738" id="page738"></a>738</span>
advanced on the 14th of May 1685 to the English peerage under
the title of Baron Churchill of Sandridge in Hertfordshire.
When the duke of Monmouth attempted his ill-fated enterprise
in the western counties, the second position in command of the
king&rsquo;s army was bestowed on Lord Churchill, and on the 3rd of
July 1685 he was raised to the rank of major-general. Through
his vigilance and energy at the battle of Sedgemoor (July 6)
victory declared itself on the king&rsquo;s side. After the death of
Monmouth he withdrew as far as possible from the administration
of public business, but both he and his wife remained the
favourite attendants of the princess Anne. Whilst on his
embassy to the French court he had declared with emphasis
that if the king of England should change the religion of the
state he should at once leave his service, and it was not long
before the design of James became apparent to the world.
Churchill was one of the first to send overtures of obedience to
the prince of Orange, to whom he had gone on a commission
in 1678. Although he continued in a high position under James
and drew the emoluments of his places, he promised William of
Orange to use every exertion to bring over the troops to his side.
James had been warned against putting any trust in the loyalty
of the man on whom he had showered so many favours, but the
warnings were in vain, and on the landing of the Dutch prince
at Brixham Churchill was promoted to be lieutenant-general
(Nov. 7, 1688) and was sent against him with five thousand
men. When the royal army had advanced to the downs of
Wiltshire and a battle seemed imminent, James was dismayed at
finding that in the dead of night his general had stolen away like
a thief into the opposite camp.</p>

<p>Churchill was sworn as a privy councillor on the 14th of
February 1688/9 and on the 9th of April became earl of Marlborough.
William felt, however, that he could not place implicit
reliance in his friend&rsquo;s integrity; and, with a clear sense of the
manner in which Marlborough&rsquo;s talents might be employed
without any detriment to the stability of his throne, he sent him
in June 1689 with the army into the Netherlands, and in the
autumn of 1690 into Ireland, where owing to his generalship
Cork and Kinsale fell into his hands after short sieges. For
some time there was no open avowal of any distrust in Marlborough&rsquo;s
loyalty, but in May 1692 he was thrown into the
Tower on an accusation of treason. Though the evidence
which could be brought against him was slight, and he was
soon set at liberty, there is no doubt that Marlborough was in
close relations with the exiled king at St Germains, and that he
even went so far as to disclose, in May 1694, to his late master
the intention of the English to attack the town of Brest. The
talents of the statesmen of this reign were chiefly displayed in
their attempts to convince both the exiled and the reigning
king of England of their attachment to his fortunes. The sin of
Marlborough lay in the fact that he had been favoured above his
fellows by each in turn, and that he betrayed both alike
apparently without scruple or without shame. Once again
during the Fenwick plot of 1696 he was charged with treason, but
William, knowing that if he pushed Marlborough and his friends
to extremities there were no other statesmen on whom he could
rely, contented himself with ignoring the accusation of Sir John
Fenwick, and with executing that conspirator himself. In 1698
the forgiven traitor was made governor to the young duke of
Gloucester, the only one of Anne&rsquo;s numerous children who gave
promise of attaining to manhood. During the last years of
William&rsquo;s reign Marlborough once more was placed in positions
of responsibility. His daughters were married into the most
prominent families of the land; Henrietta, the eldest, became the
wife of Francis, the eldest son of Lord Godolphin; the second,
the loveliest woman at the court, with her father&rsquo;s tact and temper
and her mother&rsquo;s beauty, married Charles, Lord Spencer,
the only surviving son of the earl of Sunderland. Higher
honours came on the accession of Queen Anne in March 1702.
He was at once appointed a Knight of the Garter, captain-general
of the English troops both at home and abroad, and master-general
of the ordnance. The new queen did not forget the life-long
service of his wife; three positions at the court by which she
was enabled to continue by the side of the sovereign were
united in her person. The queen showed her devotion to her
friend by another signal mark of favour. The rangership of
Windsor Park was granted her for life, with the especial object
of enabling Lady Marlborough to live in the Great Lodge. These
were the opening days of many years of fame and power. A week
or two after the death of William it was agreed by the three
great powers, England, Holland and Austria, which formed the
grand alliance, that war should be declared against France on
the same day, and on the 4th of May 1702 the War of the Spanish
Succession was declared by the three countries. Marlborough
was made commander-in-chief of the united armies of England
and Holland, but throughout the war his plans were impeded by
the jealousy of the commanders who were nominally his inferiors,
and by the opposite aims of the various countries that were
striving to break the power of France. He himself wished to
penetrate into the French lines; the anxiety of the Dutch was
for the maintenance of their frontier and for an augmentation
of their territory; the desire of the Austrian emperor was to
secure that his son the Archduke Charles should rule over Spain.
To secure concerted action by these different powers taxed all
the diplomacy of Marlborough, but he succeeded for the most
part in his desires. In the first year of the campaign it was shown
that the armies of the French were not invincible. Several
fortresses which Louis XIV. had seized upon surrendered to the
allies. Kaiserswerth on the Rhine surrendered on the 15th of
June, and Venlo on the Meuse on the 23rd of September. The
prosperous commercial town of Liége with its commanding
citadel capitulated on the 29th of October. The successes of
Marlborough caused much rejoicing in his own country, and
for these brilliant exploits he was raised (Dec. 14, 1702)
to be duke of Marlborough, and received a grant of £5000 per
annum for the queen&rsquo;s life. In the spring of the following year a
crushing blow fell upon the duke and duchess. Their eldest and
only surviving son, the marquess of Blandford, was seized whilst
at King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge (under the care of Francis Hare,
afterwards bishop of Chichester), with the small-pox, and died
on the 20th of February 1703, in his seventeenth year. His
talents had already justified the prediction that he would rise
to the highest position in the state.</p>

<p>The result of the campaign of 1703 inspired the French king
with fresh hopes of ultimate victory. The dashing plans of
Marlborough were frustrated by the opposition of his Dutch
colleagues. When he wished to invade the French territory
they urged him to besiege Bonn, and he was compelled to accede
to their wishes. It surrendered on the 15th of May, whereupon
he returned to his original plan of attacking Antwerp; but, in
consequence of the incapacity of the Dutch leaders, the generals
(Villeroi and Boufflers) of the French army surprised the Dutch
division on the 30th of June and inflicted on it a loss of many
thousands of men. Marlborough was forced to abandon his
enterprise, and all the compensation which he received was the
capture of the insignificant forts of Huy and Limburg. After
a year of comparative failure for the allies, Louis XIV. was emboldened
to enter upon an offensive movement against Austria;
and Marlborough, smarting under the misadventures of 1703,
was eager to meet him. A magnificent army was sent by the
French king, under the command of Marshal Tallard, to join the
forces of the elector of Bavaria and to march by the Danube
so as to seize Vienna itself. Marlborough divined the intention
of the expedition, and while making a feint of marching into
Alsace led his troops into Bavaria. The two armies (that under
Marlborough and Prince Eugène numbering more than fifty
thousand men, whilst Tallard&rsquo;s forces were nearly four thousand
stronger) met in battle near the village of Blenheim on the left
bank of the Danube. The French commander made the mistake
of supposing that the enemy&rsquo;s attack would be directed against
his position in the village, and he concentrated an excessive
number of his troops at that point. The early part of the fight
was in favour of the French. Three times were the troops led by
Prince Eugène, which were attacking the Bavarians, the enemy&rsquo;s
left wing, driven back in confusion; Marlborough&rsquo;s cavalry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page739" id="page739"></a>739</span>
failed on their first attack in breaking the line of the enemy&rsquo;s
centre. But in the end the victory of the allies was conclusive.
Nearly thirty thousand of the French and Bavarians were killed
and wounded, and eleven thousand of the French who had been
driven down to the Danube were forced to surrender. Bavaria
fell into the hands of the allies. Never was a victory more
eagerly welcomed than this, and never was a conquering leader
more rewarded than Marlborough. Poets and prose writers
were employed to do him honour, and the lines of Addison comparing
the English commander to the angel who passed over
&ldquo;pale Britannia&rdquo; in the storm of 1703 have been famous for over
two centuries. The manor of Woodstock, which was transferred
by act of parliament from the crown to the duke, was a reward
more after his own heart. The gift even in that form was noble,
but the queen heightened it by instructing Sir John Vanbrugh
to build a palace in the park at the royal expense, and £240,000
of public money was spent on the buildings. He was also created
a prince of the empire and the principality of Mindelheim was
formed in his honour.</p>

<p>The following year was not marked by any stirring incident.
Marlborough was hampered by tedious formalities at the Hague
and by jealousies at the German courts. The armies of the
French were again brought up to their full standard, but the
generals of Louis were instructed to entrench themselves behind
earthworks and to act on the defensive. In the darkness of a
July night these lines were broken through near Tirlemont,
and the French were forced to take shelter under the walls of
Louvain. Marlborough in vain urged an attack upon them in
their new position, and when 1705 had passed away the forces
of the French king had suffered no diminution. This immunity
from disaster tempted Villeroi in the next spring into meeting
the allied forces in an open fight, but his assurance proved his
ruin. Through the superior tactics of Marlborough the battle of
Ramillies (May 23, 1706) ended in the total rout of the French,
and caused the transference of nearly the whole of Brabant
and Flanders to the allies. Five days afterwards the victor
entered Brussels in state, and the inhabitants acknowledged
the rule of the archduke. Antwerp and Ostend surrendered
themselves with slight loss. Menin held out until three thousand
of the soldiers of the allies were laid low around its walls, but
Dendermonde, which Louis had forty years previously besieged
in vain, quickly gave itself up to the resistless Marlborough.
Again a year of activity and triumph was succeeded by a period
of languor and depression. During the whole of 1707 fortune
inclined to the other side, with the result that in July 1708
Ghent and Bruges returned to the allegiance of the French, and
Marlborough, fearing that their example might be followed by
the other cities, advanced with his whole army towards Oudenarde.
Had the counsels of Vendôme, one of the ablest of the
French generals, prevailed, the fight might have had a different
issue, but his suggestions were disregarded by the duke of
Burgundy, the grandson of Louis, and the battle, which raged
on the high ground above Oudenarde, ended in their defeat
(July 11, 1708). After this victory Marlborough, ever anxious for
decisive measures, wished to advance on Paris, but he was overruled.
The allied army invested the town of Lille, on the fortifications
of which Vauban had expended an immensity of thought;
and after a struggle of nearly four months, and the loss to the
combatants of thirty thousand men, the citadel was surrendered
by Marshal Boufflers on the 9th of December. By the end of the
year Brabant was again subject to the rule of the allies. The
suffering in France at this time weighed so heavily upon the
people that its proud king humbled himself to sue for peace.
Each of the allies in turn did he supplicate, and Torcy his minister
endeavoured by promises of large sums of money to obtain the
support of Marlborough to his proposals. These attempts were
in vain, and when the winter passed away a French army of one
hundred and ten thousand, under the command of Villars, took
the field. On the 3rd of September 1709 Tournay capitulated,
and the two leaders, Marlborough and Eugène, led their forces
to Mons, in spite of the attempt of Villars to prevent them.
For the last time during the protracted war the two armies met
in fair fight at Malplaquet, on the south of Mons (Sept. 11,
1709), where the French leader had strengthened his position
by extensive earthworks. The fight was long and doubtful,
and although the French ultimately retreated under the direction
of Boufflers, for Villars had been wounded on the knee, it was in
good order, and their losses were less than those of their opponents.
The campaign lasted for a year or two after this indecisive
contest, but it was not signalized by any such &ldquo;glorious victory&rdquo;
as Blenheim. All that the English could plume themselves on
was the acquisition of a few such fortresses as Douai and Bethune,
and all that the French had to fear was the gradual tightening
of the enemy&rsquo;s chain until it reached the walls of Paris. The
energies of the French were concentrated in the construction of
fresh lines of defence, until their commander boasted that his
position was impregnable. In this way the war dragged on until
the conclusion of the Peace of Utrecht in June 1712.</p>

<p>These victorious campaigns had not prevented the position of
Marlborough from being undermined by party intrigues at home.
In the early part of Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign his political friends were
to be found among the Tories, and the ministry under Sidney
Godolphin was chiefly composed of members of that party.
After a year or two, however, the more ardent Tories withdrew,
and two younger adherents of the same cause, Harley and
St John, were introduced in May 1704 into the ministry. The
duchess, partly through the influence of her son-in-law, the earl
of Sunderland, who came into office against the queen&rsquo;s wish on
the 3rd of December 1706, and partly through the opposition
of the Tories to the French war, had gone over to the Whig
cause, and she pressed her views on the sovereign with more
vehemence than discretion. She had obtained for her indigent
cousin, Abigail Hill, a small position at court, and the poor
relation very soon began to injure the benefactor who had
befriended her. With Hill&rsquo;s assistance Harley and St John
widened the breach with the queen which was commenced by
the imperious manner of the duchess. The love of the two
friends changed into hate, and no opportunity for humiliating
the family of Marlborough was allowed to pass neglected.
Sunderland and Godolphin were the first to fall (July-Aug.
1710); a few months later the duchess was dismissed from her
offices; and, although Marlborough himself was permitted to
continue in his position a short time longer, his fall was only
delayed until the last day of 1711. Life in England had become
so unpleasant that he went to the Continent in November 1712
and remained abroad until the death of Anne (Aug. 1, 1714).</p>

<p>Then he once more returned to England and resumed his old
military posts, but he took little part in public affairs. Even if
he had wished to regain his commanding position in the country,
ill health would have prevented him from obtaining his desires.
Johnson indeed says, in the <i>Vanity of Human Wishes</i>, that &ldquo;the
streams of dotage&rdquo; flowed from his eyes; but this is a poetical
exaggeration. It is certain that at the time of his death he was
able to understand the remarks of others and to express his own
wishes. At four o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 16th of June
1722 he died at Cranbourn Lodge, near Windsor. His remains
were at first deposited in Westminster Abbey, in the vault at
the east end of King Henry VII.&rsquo;s chapel, but they now rest
in a mausoleum in the chapel at Blenheim.</p>

<p>His widow, to whom must be assigned a considerable share both
in his rise and in his fall, survived till the 18th of October 1744.
Those years were spent in bitter animosity with many within
and without her own family. Left by her husband with the
command of boundless wealth, she used it for the vindication
of his memory and for the justification of her own resentment.
Two of the leading opponents of the Whig ministry, Chesterfield
and Pitt, were especially honoured by her attentions. To Pitt
she left ten thousand pounds, to the other statesman twice that
sum and a reversionary interest in her landed property at
Wimbledon. Whilst a widow she received numerous offers of
marriage from titled suitors. She refused them all: from her
marriage to her death her heart had no other inmate than
the man as whose wife she had become almost a rival to
royalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page740" id="page740"></a>740</span></p>

<p>The rapid rise of Marlborough to the highest position in the
State was due to his singular tact and his diplomatic skill in the
management of men. In an age remarkable for grace of manner
and for adroitness of compliment, his courteous demeanour and
the art with which he refused or granted a favour extorted the
admiration of every one with whom he came in contact. Through
his consideration for the welfare of his soldiers he held together
for years an army drawn from every nation in Christendom.
His talents may not have been profound (he possessed &ldquo;an
excellent plain understanding and sound judgment&rdquo; is the
opinion of Lord Chesterfield), but they were such as Englishmen
love. Alike in planning and in executing, he took infinite pains
in all points of detail. Nothing escaped his observation, and in
the hottest moment of the fight the coolness of his intellect
shone conspicuous. His enemies indeed affected to attribute
his uniform success in the field to fortune, and they magnified
his love of money by drawing up balance sheets which included
every penny which he had received, but omitted the pounds
which he had spent in the cause he had sincerely at heart. All
that can be alleged in excuse of his attempts to serve two masters,
the king whom he had deserted and the king who had received
him into favour, is that not one of his associates was without sin
in this respect.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The books on Marlborough are very numerous. Under his name
in the catalogue of the British Museum there are 165 entries, and
44 under that of his wife. The chief works are Lediard&rsquo;s, Archdeacon
William Coxe&rsquo;s (1818-1819), Sir Archibald Alison&rsquo;s (1855),
and Viscount Wolseley&rsquo;s (1894) <i>Lives</i>, but Wolseley stops with the
accession of Queen Anne; a French memoir in three volumes, 1808;
Marlborough&rsquo;s <i>Letters and Despatches</i>, edited by Sir George Murray
(5 vols., 1845); and the interesting summaries of Mrs Creighton
(1879) and George Saintsbury (1885). The descriptions in John
Hill Burton&rsquo;s <i>Reign of Queen Anne</i> of the battle scenes of Marlborough
are from personal observation. A good account of his birthplace
and country will be found in G. P. R. Pulman&rsquo;s <i>Book of the Axe
District</i> (4th ed., 1875); and for the home of the duchess the reader
can refer to the <i>History of Hertfordshire</i>, by J. E. Cussans. A memoir
of her, by one of her descendants, Mrs Arthur Colville, appeared in
1904. The pamphlets written on her conduct at court relate to
matters of little interest at the present time.</p>

W. of London, on the Great Western and the Midland and South
Western Junction railways. Pop. (1901), 3887. It is an old-fashioned
place on the skirts of Savernake Forest, lying in a
valley of the chalk uplands known as Marlborough Downs, and
traversed by the river Kennet. It consists mainly of one broad
street, in which a majority of the houses are Jacobean; those on
the north side, which have projecting upper storeys, forming the
colonnade commended in the Diary of Samuel Pepys for 1668.
St Peter&rsquo;s church, a Perpendicular building, is said to have been
the scene of the ordination of Cardinal Wolsey in 1498. The
church of Preshute, largely rebuilt, but preserving its Norman
pillars, has a curious piscina, and a black basalt font of great
size dating from 1100-1150, in which according to a very old
tradition King John was baptized. Other noteworthy buildings
are the town-hall, 16th century grammar school and Marlborough
College. This important public school was opened in 1843,
originally for the sons of clergymen, by whom alone certain
scholarships are tenable. The number of boys is about 600.
Marlborough possesses little trade other than agricultural;
but there are breweries, tanneries and roperies. The town is
governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area,
598 acres.</p>

<p>The antiquity of Marlborough is shown by the Castle Mound,
a British earthwork, which local legend makes the grave of
Merlin; and the name of Marlborough has been regarded as a
corrupt form of Merlin&rsquo;s Berg or Rock.</p>

<p>Near the site of the modern Marlborough (<i>Merleberge</i>, <i>Marleberge</i>)
was originally a Roman <i>castrum</i> called Cunetio, and later
there was a Norman fortress in which William I. established a
mint. In Domesday it was royal demesne and during the
following centuries figures in numerous grants generally as the
dowry of queens. The castle, built under Henry I., by Roger,
bishop of Salisbury, was held for Matilda against Stephen, and
became a favourite residence of Henry II., Savernake being a
royal deer-park. In 1267 Henry III. held his last parliament
here, at which the Statute of Marlborough was passed. The
castle ceased to be an important stronghold after the Wars of
the Roses, but was garrisoned for Charles I. by its owners, the
Seymour family. Marlborough itself, however, is mentioned by
Clarendon as &ldquo;the most notoriously disaffected [town] in Wiltshire,&rdquo;
and was captured by the royal forces in 1642, and partly
burnt. At the Restoration Charles II. was received and magnificently
entertained by Lord Seymour, whose mansion forms
the oldest part of Marlborough College. The town was constituted
a suffragan see by Henry II. Sacheverell, the politician
and divine, was born here in 1674, and educated at the grammar
school. In 1653 the town was nearly destroyed by fire, and it
again suffered in 1679 and 1690; after which an act was passed
forbidding the use of thatch. Marlborough, from its position
on the Great Bath Road, was a famous coaching centre.</p>

<p>The first charter was granted by John in 1204, and conferred
a gild merchant, together with freedom from all pleas except
pleas of the Crown and from all secular exactions by sea and land.
This was confirmed by subsequent sovereigns from Henry III.
to Henry VIII. Later charters were obtained from Henry IV.
in 1407 and from Elizabeth in 1576. The former granted some
additional exemptions whilst the latter incorporated the town
under the title of mayor and burgesses of Marlborough. The
corporation was finally reconstructed in 1835 under the title of a
mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Marlborough returned
two members to parliament until 1867 when the number was
reduced to one, and in 1885 the representation was merged in
that of the county. A yearly fair was granted by John in 1204,
for eight days from August 14, and two more by Henry III.
for three days from November 11 and June 29 respectively.
In 1204 John also granted a weekly market on Wednesday and
Saturday. In Tudor times the corn trade prospered here.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARLBOROUGH,<a name="ar167" id="ar167"></a></span> a city of Middlesex county, Massachusetts,
U.S.A., about 28 m. W. of Boston. Pop. (1900), 13,609 (3311
were foreign-born); (1910), 14,579; it is served by the Boston &amp;
Maine and the New York New Haven &amp; Hartford railways, and
by interurban electric lines. The city, with a total area of
21.08 sq. m., lies in a fertile hilly country, and contains several
ponds, including the beautiful Williams Pond, which covers
<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> sq. m. A public library was established here in 1792; it was
housed in a new building in 1904. Other public buildings are
the city hall, the Federal building and a state armoury. There
is a boarding school for girls, St Ann&rsquo;s Academy (1887), under
the direction of the Sisters of St Ann. The city&rsquo;s importance
is industrial; in 1905 its factory product was valued at $7,468,849
(an increase of 66% since 1900), of which 88.6% was the value
of boots and shoes. Whether the city is named from Marlborough
in Wiltshire, or, as seems more probable, because of
early spellings &ldquo;Marlberg&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marlbridge,&rdquo; from the presence
of marl in the neighbourhood, is uncertain. Settlers from Sudbury
in 1665 took possession of a hill called by the Indians
Whipsuffenicke and gradually hemmed in the Christian Indian
village of Ockoocangansett (or Ognoikonguamescitt), on an
adjoining hill still bearing this name. The town was incorporated
in 1660. It was destroyed by Indians in March 1676,
during King Philip&rsquo;s war, and was abandoned for a year. Westborough
was separated from it in 1717, Southborough in 1727,
and a part of Berlin in 1784; parts of it were annexed to Northborough
in 1807, to Bolton in 1829 and to Hudson in 1866; and
it annexed parts of Framingham in 1791, and of Southborough
in 1843. In 1890 it was incorporated as a city.</p>

study she made a successful stage début, but was compelled in
consequence of deafness to abandon this career. She then
became reader and travelling companion to her patroness, and
her life at the court and on her many travels furnished her with

<p><span class="bold">MARLOW<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Great Marlow</span>), a market town in the Wycombe
parliamentary division of Buckinghamshire, England, 31<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> m.
W. of London on a branch of the Great Western railway. Pop.
of urban district (1901), 4526. It is beautifully situated on the
north (left) bank of the Thames, which is here confined closely
between low wooded hills. A weir and lock, near which rise the
high tower and spire of the modern church of All Saints, separate
two fine reaches of the river, and the town is a favourite resort
for boating and fishing. The village of Little Marlow, where the
foundations of a Benedictine nunnery of the time of Henry III.
have been revealed by excavation, lies near the river two miles
below. The town is, as a whole, modern in appearance, but a few
old houses remain, such as the grammar school, founded as a
bluecoat school in 1624, adjoining which is a house occupied by
the poet Shelley in 1817. The town has manufactures of chairs,
lace and embroidery, paper mills and breweries.</p>

<p>Great Marlow (<i>Merlaue</i>, <i>Merlawe</i>, <i>Marlowe</i>, <i>Marlow</i>) appears
as a manor in Domesday Book, but its &ldquo;borough and liberties&rdquo;
are not mentioned before 1261. It was then held by the earls
of Gloucester, and its importance was probably due to the bridge
across the Thames, first built, according to tradition, by the
Templars at Bisham. No charter of incorporation was ever
granted to the town, but there are faint traces of its constitution
in the 14th century. In 1342 the mayor and burgesses presented
to a chantry and continued to be the patrons till 1394. Later
writs addressed to the town only mention two bailiffs as officers
of the borough, nor were the pontage rights and dues held by it
until the 15th century. Two burgesses sat in parliament from
1300 to 1309, but the representation of the borough lapsed until
1621, when the right to return members was re-established.
After the Reform Bill of 1832 the boundaries of the parliamentary
borough were enlarged, but in 1867 its representation was
reduced to one member, and in 1885 was merged in that of
the county. No grant of a market in the borough has been
found, but a market was held by the Despensers who had succeeded
the De Clares as lords of the manor in the 14th century.
In the 16th century the market seems to have been given up, but
it was revived and held in the 18th century, only to disappear
again before 1862. Fairs were mentioned in 1306 on the death
of Gilbert de Clare, when they were held on St Luke&rsquo;s Day and on
the Wednesday in Whit-week by the earl of Gloucester, and Hugh
le Despenser was granted a fair in his manor of Marlow in 1324.
In 1792 there were two fairs, one of which, for horses and cattle,
is still held on the 29th of October. Lace and satin-stitch work
used to be made to a considerable extent.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARLOWE, CHRISTOPHER<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> (1564-1593), English dramatist,
the father of English tragedy, and instaurator of dramatic
blank verse, the eldest son of a shoemaker at Canterbury, was
born in that city on the 6th of February 1564. He was christened
at St George&rsquo;s Church, Canterbury, on the 26th of February,
1563/4, some two months before Shakespeare&rsquo;s baptism at Stratford-on-Avon.
His father, John Marlowe, is said to have been
the grandson of John Morley or Marlowe, a substantial tanner of
Canterbury. The father, who survived by a dozen years or so
his illustrious son, married on the 22nd of May 1561 Catherine,
daughter of Christopher Arthur, at one time rector of St Peter&rsquo;s,
Canterbury, who had been ejected by Queen Mary as a married
minister. The dramatist received the rudiments of his education
at the King&rsquo;s School, Canterbury, which he entered at
Michaelmas 1578, and where he had as his fellow-pupils Richard
Boyle, afterwards known as the great earl of Cork, and Will
Lyly, the brother of the dramatist. Stephen Gosson entered
the same school a little before, and William Harvey, the famous
physician, a little after Marlowe. He went to Cambridge as
one of Archbishop Parker&rsquo;s scholars from the King&rsquo;s School, and
matriculated at Benet (Corpus Christi) College, on the 17th of
March 1571, taking his B.A. degree in 1584, and that of M.A.
three or four years later.</p>

<p>Francis Kett, the mystic, burnt in 1589 for heresy, was a
fellow and tutor of his college, and may have had some share in
developing Marlowe&rsquo;s opinions in religious matters. Marlowe&rsquo;s
classical acquirements were of a kind which was then extremely
common, being based for the most part upon a minute acquaintance
with Roman mythology, as revealed in Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>.
His spirited translation of Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Amores</i> (printed
1596), which was at any rate commenced at Cambridge, does not
seem to point to any very intimate acquaintance with the grammar
and syntax of the Latin tongue. Before 1587 he seems to
have quitted Cambridge for London, where he attached himself
to the Lord Admiral&rsquo;s Company of Players, under the leadership
of the famed actor Edward Alleyn, and almost at once began
writing for the stage. Of Marlowe&rsquo;s career in London, apart
from his four great theatrical successes, we know hardly anything;
but he evidently knew Thomas Kyd, who shared his unorthodox
opinions. Nash criticized his verse, Greene affected to shudder
at his atheism; Gabriel Harvey maligned his memory. On the
other hand Marlowe was intimate with the Walsinghams of
Scadbury, Chiselhurst, kinsmen of Sir Francis Walsingham: he
was also the personal friend of Sir Walter Raleigh, and perhaps
of the poetical earl of Oxford, with both of whom, and with such
men as Walter Warner and Robert Hughes the mathematicians,
Thomas Harriott the notable astronomer, and Matthew
Royden, the dramatist is said to have met in free converse.
Either this free converse or the licentious character of some of
the young dramatist&rsquo;s tirades seems to have sown a suspicion
among the strait-laced that his morals left everything to be
desired. It is probable enough that this attitude of reprobation
drove a man of so exalted a disposition as Marlowe into a more insurgent
attitude than he would have otherwise adopted. He seems
at any rate to have been associated with what was denounced as
Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s school of atheism, and to have dallied with
opinions which were then regarded as putting a man outside the
pale of civilized humanity. As the result of some depositions
made by Thomas Kyd under the influence of torture, the Privy
Council were upon the eve of investigating some serious charges
against Marlowe when his career was abruptly and somewhat scandalously
terminated. The order had already been issued for his
arrest, when he was slain in a quarrel by a man variously named
(Archer and Ingram) at Deptford, at the end of May 1593, and he
was buried on the 1st of June in the churchyard of St Nicholas at
Deptford. The following September Gabriel Harvey referred
to him as &ldquo;dead of the plague.&rdquo; The disgraceful particulars
attached to the tragedy of Marlowe in the popular mind would
not seem to have appeared until four years later (1597) when
Thomas Beard, the Puritan author of <i>The Theatre of God&rsquo;s
Judgements</i>, used the death of this playmaker and atheist as
one of his warning examples of the vengeance of God. Upon
the embellishments of this story, such as that of Francis Meres
the critic, in 1598, that Marlowe came to be &ldquo;stabbed to death
by a bawdy servingman, a rival of his in his lewde love,&rdquo; or that
of William Vaughan in the <i>Golden Grove</i> of 1600, in which the
unfortunate poet&rsquo;s dagger is thrust into his own eye in prevention
of his felonious assault upon an innocent man, his guest, it is
impossible now to pronounce. We really do not know the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page742" id="page742"></a>742</span>
circumstances of Marlowe&rsquo;s death. The probability is he was
killed in a brawl, and his atheism must be interpreted not according
to the <i>ex parte</i> accusation of one Richard Baines, a professional
informer (among the Privy Council records), but as a species
of rationalistic antinomianism, dialectic in character, and closely
related to the deflection from conventional orthodoxy for which
Kett was burnt at Norwich in 1589. A few months before the
end of his life there is reason to believe that he transferred his
services from the Lord Admiral&rsquo;s to Lord Strange&rsquo;s Company,
and may have thus been brought into communication with
Shakespeare, who in such plays as <i>Richard II.</i> and <i>Richard III.</i>
owed not a little to the influence of his romantic predecessor.</p>

<p>Marlowe&rsquo;s career as a dramatist lies between the years 1587
and 1593, and the four great plays to which reference has been
made were <i>Tamburlaine the Great</i>, an heroic epic in dramatic
form divided into two parts of five acts each (1587, printed in
1590); <i>Dr Faustus</i> (1588, entered at Stationers&rsquo; Hall 1601);
<i>The Famous Tragedy of the Rich Jew of Malta</i> (dating perhaps
from 1589, acted in 1592, printed in 1633); and <i>Edward the
Second</i> (printed 1594). The very first words of <i>Tamburlaine</i>
sound the trumpet note of attack in the older order of things
dramatic:&mdash;</p>

<p>It leapt with a bound to a place beside Kyd&rsquo;s <i>Spanish Tragedy</i>,
and few plays have been more imitated by rivals (Greene&rsquo;s
<i>Alphonsus of Aragon</i>, Peek&rsquo;s <i>Battle of Alcazar, Selimus, Scanderbeg</i>)
or more keenly satirized by the jealousy and prejudice of
out-distanced competitors.</p>
<div class="author">(T. Se.)</div>

<p>The majestic and exquisite excellence of various lines and
passages in Marlowe&rsquo;s first play must be admitted to relieve, if
it cannot be allowed to redeem, the stormy monotony of Titanic
truculence which blusters like a simoom through the noisy course
of its ten fierce acts. With many and heavy faults, there is something
of genuine greatness in <i>Tamburlaine the Great</i>; and for two
grave reasons it must always be remembered with distinction
and mentioned with honour. It is the first poem ever written in
English blank verse, as distinguished from mere rhymeless decasyllabics;
and it contains one of the noblest passages, perhaps
indeed the noblest, in the literature of the world, ever written by
one of the greatest masters of poetry in loving praise of the
glorious delights and sublime submission to the everlasting limits
of his art. In its highest and most distinctive qualities, in
unfaltering and infallible command of the right note of music
and the proper tone of colour for the finest touches of poetic
execution, no poet of the most elaborate modern school, working
at ease upon every consummate resource of luxurious learning
and leisurely refinement, has ever excelled the best and most
representative work of a man who had literally no models before
him and probably or evidently was often if not always compelled
to write against time for his living.</p>

<p>The just and generous judgment passed by Goethe on the
<i>Faustus</i> of his English predecessor in tragic treatment of the
same subject is somewhat more than sufficient to counterbalance
the slighting or the sneering references to that magnificent poem
which might have been expected from the ignorance of Byron
or the incompetence of Hallam. And the particular note of
merit observed, the special point of the praise conferred, by
the great German poet should be no less sufficient to dispose of
the vulgar misconception yet lingering among sciolists and pretenders
to criticism, which regards a writer than whom no man
was ever born with a finer or a stronger instinct for perfection
of excellence in execution as a mere noble savage of letters, a
rough self-taught sketcher or scribbler of crude and rude genius,
whose unhewn blocks of verse had in them some veins of rare
enough metal to be quarried and polished by Shakespeare. What
most impressed the author of <i>Faust</i> in the work of Marlowe was a
quality the want of which in the author of <i>Manfred</i> is proof
enough to consign his best work to the second or third class at
most. &ldquo;How greatly it is all planned!&rdquo; the first requisite of
all great work, and one of which the highest genius possible to a
greatly gifted barbarian could by no possibility understand the
nature or conceive the existence. That Goethe &ldquo;had thought
of translating it&rdquo; is perhaps hardly less precious a tribute to its
greatness than the fact that it has been actually and admirably
translated by the matchless translator of Shakespeare&mdash;the son
of Victor Hugo; whose labour of love may thus be said to have
made another point in common, and forged as it were another
link of union, between Shakespeare and the young master of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s youth. Of all great poems in dramatic form
it is perhaps the most remarkable for absolute singleness of aim
and simplicity of construction; yet is it wholly free from all
possible imputation of monotony or aridity. <i>Tamburlaine</i> is
monotonous in the general roll and flow of its stately and sonorous
verse through a noisy wilderness of perpetual bluster and slaughter;
but the unity of tone and purpose in <i>Doctor Faustus</i> is not
unrelieved by change of manner and variety of incident. The
comic scenes, written evidently with as little of labour as of relish,
are for the most part scarcely more than transcripts, thrown into
the form of dialogue, from a popular prose <i>History of Dr Faustus</i>,
and therefore should be set down as little to the discredit as to
the credit of the poet. Few masterpieces of any age in any
language can stand beside this tragic poem&mdash;it has hardly the
structure of a play&mdash;for the qualities of terror and splendour,
for intensity of purpose and sublimity of note. In the vision
of Helen, for example, the intense perception of loveliness gives
actual sublimity to the sweetness and radiance of mere beauty
in the passionate and spontaneous selection of words the most
choice and perfect; and in like manner the sublimity of simplicity
in Marlowe&rsquo;s conception and expression of the agonies endured
by Faustus under the immediate imminence of his doom gives
the highest note of beauty, the quality of absolute fitness and
propriety, to the sheer straightforwardness of speech in which
his agonizing horror finds vent ever more and more terrible from
the first to the last equally beautiful and fearful verse of that
tremendous monologue which has no parallel in all the range of
tragedy.</p>

<p>It is now a commonplace of criticism to observe and regret the
decline of power and interest after the opening acts of <i>The Jew
of Malta</i>. This decline is undeniable, though even the latter part
of the play (the text of which is very corrupt) is not wanting
in rough energy; but the first two acts would be sufficient
foundation for the durable fame of a dramatic poet. In the blank
verse of Milton alone&mdash;who perhaps was hardly less indebted
than Shakespeare was before him to Marlowe as the first English
master of word-music in its grander forms&mdash;has the glory or the
melody of passages in the opening soliloquy of Barabbas been
possibly surpassed. The figure of the hero before it degenerates
into caricature is as finely touched as the poetic execution is excellent;
and the rude and rapid sketches of the minor characters
show at least some vigour and vivacity of touch.</p>

<p>In <i>Edward the Second</i> the interest rises and the execution
improves as visibly and as greatly with the course of the advancing
story as they decline in <i>The Jew of Malta</i>. The scene of the
king&rsquo;s deposition at Kenilworth is almost as much finer in tragic
effect and poetic quality as it is shorter and less elaborate than
the corresponding scene in Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>King Richard II</i>. The
terror of the death-scene undoubtedly rises into horror; but this
horror is with skilful simplicity of treatment preserved from
passing into disgust. In pure poetry, in sublime and splendid
imagination, this tragedy is excelled by <i>Doctor Faustus</i>; in
dramatic power and positive impression of natural effect it is
certainly the masterpiece of Marlowe. It was almost inevitable,
in the hands of any poet but Shakespeare, that none of the
characters represented should be capable of securing or even
exciting any finer sympathy or more serious interest than
attends on the mere evolution of successive events or the mere
display of emotions (except always in the great scene of the
deposition) rather animal than spiritual in their expression
of rage or tenderness or suffering. The exact balance of
mutual effect, the final note of scenic harmony, between ideal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page743" id="page743"></a>743</span>
conception and realistic execution is not yet struck with perfect
accuracy of touch and security of hand; but on this point also
Marlowe has here come nearer by many degrees to Shakespeare
than any of his other predecessors have ever come near
to Marlowe.</p>

<p>Of <i>The Massacre at Paris</i> (acted in 1593, printed 1600?) it is
impossible to judge fairly from the garbled fragment of its
genuine text which is all that has come down to us. To Mr
Collier, among numberless other obligations, we owe the discovery
of a noble passage excised in the piratical edition which gives
us the only version extant of this unlucky play, and which, it
must be allowed, contains nothing of quite equal value. This
is obviously an occasional and polemical work, and being as it
is overcharged with the anti-Catholic passion of the time has a
typical quality which gives it some empirical significance and
interest. That antipapal ardour is indeed the only note of unity
in a rough and ragged chronicle which shambles and stumbles
onward from the death of Queen Jeanne of Navarre to the murder
of the last Valois. It is possible to conjecture, what it would
be fruitless to affirm, that it gave a hint in the next century to
Nathaniel Lee for his far superior and really admirable tragedy
on the same subject, issued ninety-seven years after the death
of Marlowe.</p>

<p>In the tragedy of <i>Dido Queen of Carthage</i> (completed by
Thomas Nash, produced and printed 1594), a servile fidelity to
the text of Virgil&rsquo;s narrative has naturally resulted in the failure
which might have been expected from an attempt at once to
transcribe what is essentially inimitable and to reproduce it
under the hopelessly alien conditions of dramatic adaptation.
The one really noble passage in a generally feeble and incomposite
piece of work is, however, uninspired by the unattainable model
to which the dramatists have been only too obsequious in their
subservience. It is as nearly certain as anything can be which
depends chiefly upon cumulative and collateral evidence that
the better part of what is best in the serious scenes of <i>King Henry
VI.</i> is mainly the work of Marlowe. That he is at any rate the
principal author of the second and third plays passing under that
name among the works of Shakespeare, but first and imperfectly
printed as <i>The Contention between the two Famous Houses of York
and Lancaster</i>, can hardly be now a matter of debate among
competent judges. The crucial difficulty of criticism in this
matter is to determine, if indeed we should not rather say to
conjecture, the authorship of the humorous scenes in prose,
showing as they generally do a power of comparatively high and
pure comic realism to which nothing in the acknowledged works
of any pre-Shakespearian dramatist is even remotely comparable.
Yet, especially in the original text of these scenes as they
stand unpurified by the ultimate revision of Shakespeare or his
editors, there are tones and touches which recall rather the
clownish horseplay and homely ribaldry of his predecessors than
anything in the lighter interludes of his very earliest plays. We
find the same sort of thing which we find in their writings, only
better done than they usually do it, rather than such work as
Shakespeare&rsquo;s a little worse done than usual. And even in the
final text of the tragic or metrical scenes the highest note struck
is always, with one magnificent and unquestionable exception,
rather in the key of Marlowe at his best than of Shakespeare
while yet in great measure his disciple.</p>

<p><i>A Taming of a Shrew</i>, the play on which Shakespeare&rsquo;s comedy
was founded, has been attributed, without good reason, to
Marlowe. The passages in the play borrowed from Marlowe&rsquo;s
works provide an argument against, rather than for his authorship;
while the humorous character of the play is not in keeping
with his other work. He may have had a share in <i>The Troublesome
Raigne of King John</i> (1591), and Fleay conjectured that the
plays <i>Edward III.</i> and <i>Richard III.</i> usually included in editions
of Shakespeare are at least based on plays by Marlowe. <i>Lust&rsquo;s
Dominion</i>, printed in 1657, was incorrectly ascribed to him, and
a play no longer extant, <i>The True History of George Scanderbage</i>,
was assumed by Fleay on the authority of an obscure passage
of Gabriel Harvey to be his work. <i>The Maiden&rsquo;s Holiday</i>,
assigned to Day and Marlowe, was destroyed by Warburton&rsquo;s
cook. Day was considerably Marlowe&rsquo;s junior, and collaboration
between the two is not probable.</p>

<p>Had every copy of Marlowe&rsquo;s boyish version or perversion
of Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Elegies</i> (P. Ovidii Nasonis <i>Amorum</i> compressed into
three books) deservedly perished in the flames to which it was
judicially condemned by the sentence of a brace of prelates, it
is possible that an occasional bookworm, it is certain that no
poetical student, would have deplored its destruction, if its
demerits could in that case have been imagined. His translation
of the first book of Lucan alternately rises above the original
and falls short of it,&mdash;often inferior to the Latin in point and
weight of expressive rhetoric, now and then brightened by a
clearer note of poetry and lifted into a higher mood of verse. Its
terseness, vigour and purity of style would in any case have been
praiseworthy, but are nothing less than admirable, if not wonderful,
when we consider how close the translator has on the whole
(in spite of occasional slips into inaccuracy) kept himself to the
most rigid limit of literal representation, phrase by phrase and
often line by line. The really startling force and felicity of
occasional verses are worthier of remark than the inevitable
stiffness and heaviness of others, when the technical difficulty
of such a task is duly taken into account.</p>

<p>One of the most faultless lyrics and one of the loveliest fragments
in the whole range of descriptive and fanciful poetry would
have secured a place for Marlowe among the memorable men of
his epoch, even if his plays had perished with himself. His
<i>Passionate Shepherd</i> remains ever since unrivalled in its way&mdash;a
way of pure fancy and radiant melody without break or lapse.
The untitled fragment, on the other hand, has been very closely
rivalled, perhaps very happily imitated, but only by the greatest
lyric poet of England&mdash;by Shelley alone. Marlowe&rsquo;s poem of
<i>Hero and Leander</i> (entered at Stationers&rsquo; Hall in September
1593; completed and brought out by George Chapman, who
divided Marlowe&rsquo;s work into two sestiads and added four of his
own, 1598), closing with the sunrise which closes the night of
the lovers&rsquo; union, stands alone in its age, and far ahead of the
work of any possible competitor between the death of Spenser
and the dawn of Milton. In clear mastery of narrative and
presentation, in melodious ease and simplicity of strength, it
is not less pre-eminent than in the adorable beauty and impeccable
perfection of separate lines or passages. It is doubtful
whether the heroic couplet has ever been more finely handled.</p>

<p>The place and the value of Christopher Marlowe as a leader
among English poets it would be almost impossible for historical
criticism to over-estimate. To none of them all, perhaps, have
so many of the greatest among them been so deeply and so
directly indebted. Nor was ever any great writer&rsquo;s influence
upon his fellows more utterly and unmixedly an influence for
good. He first, and he alone, guided Shakespeare into the right
way of work; his music, in which there is no echo of any man&rsquo;s
before him, found its own echo in the more prolonged but hardly
more exalted harmony of Milton&rsquo;s. He is the greatest discoverer,
the most daring and inspired pioneer, in all our poetic literature.
Before him there was neither genuine blank verse nor a genuine
tragedy in our language. After his arrival the way was prepared,
the paths were made straight, for Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Marlowe&rsquo;s fame, so finely appreciated by Shakespeare and
Drayton, was in obscuration from the fall of the theatres until the
generation of Lamb and Hazlitt. A collected edition was brought
out by Pickering in 1826. This was greatly improved upon by
A. Dyce (1858, 1865, 1876). A one-volume edition was prepared
by Colonel Francis Cunningham in 1871. The standard edition
of Mr A. H. Bullen in 3 vols. appeared in 1884-1885 and is now
under revision. The &ldquo;Best Plays&rdquo; were edited for the Mermaid
series by Havelock Ellis with an Introduction by J. A. Symonds
(1887-1889). The best modern text is that edited by C. F. Tucker
Brooke (Oxf. Univ. Press, 1910). A sketch in outline of Marlowe&rsquo;s
Life was essayed by J. G. Lewis (Canterbury, 1891). A not very
conclusive monograph on <i>Christopher Marlowe and his Associates</i>
by J. H. Ingram, followed in 1904. For further information the
reader should consult the histories of the stage by Collier, Ward,
Fleay, Schelling, and the studies of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Predecessors by
Symonds, Mezières, Boas, Manley, Churton Collins, Feuillerat and

<p><span class="bold">MARLOWE, JULIA<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Sarah Frances Frost</span>] (1870-&emsp;&emsp;),
American actress, was born near Keswick, England, on the 17th
of August 1870, and went with her family to America in 1875.
Her first formal appearance on the stage was in New York in
1887, although she had before that travelled with a juvenile opera
company in <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i>, and afterwards was given such parts
as Maria in <i>Twelfth Night</i> in Miss Josephine Riley&rsquo;s travelling
company. Her first great success was as Parthenia in <i>Ingomar</i>,
and her subsequent presentations of Rosalind, Viola, and Julia
in <i>The Hunchback</i> confirmed her position as a &ldquo;star.&rdquo; In 1894
she married Robert Taber, an actor, with whom she played until
their divorce in 1900. Subsequently she had great success as
Barbara Frietchie in Clyde Fitch&rsquo;s play of that name, and other
dramas; and from 1904 to 1907 she acted with E. H. Sothern
in a notable series of Shakespeare plays, as well as in modern

<p><span class="bold">MARLY-LE-ROI,<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> a village of northern France in the department
of Seine-et-Oise, 5 m. N. by W. of Versailles by road.
Pop. (1906), 1409. Notwithstanding some fine country houses,
Marly is dull and unattractive, and owes all its celebrity to the
sumptuous château built towards the end of the 17th century
by Louis XIV., and now destroyed. It was originally designed
as a simple hermitage to which the king could occasionally
retire with a few of his more intimate friends from the pomp of
Versailles, but gradually it grew until it became one of the most
ruinous extravagances of the Grand Monarque. The central
pavilion (inhabited by the king himself) and its twelve subsidiary
pavilions were intended to suggest the sun surrounded by the
signs of the zodiac. Seldom visited by Louis XV., and wholly
abandoned by Louis XVI., it was demolished after the Revolution,
its art treasures having previously been dispersed, and
the remains now consist of a large basin, the Abreuvoir, a few
mouldering ivy-grown walls, some traces of parterres with magnificent
trees, the park, and the forest of 8<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2</span> sq. m., one of the most
pleasant promenades of the neighbourhood of Paris, containing
the shooting preserves of the President of the Republic.</p>

<p>Close to the Seine, half-way between Marly-le-Roi and St
Germain, is the village of Port-Marly, and one mile farther up
is the hamlet of Marly-la-Machine. Here, in 1684, an immense
hydraulic engine, driven by the current of the river, was erected;
it raised the water to a high tower, where the aqueduct of Marly
began (700 yds. in length, 75 in height, with 36 arches, still
well-preserved), carrying the waters of the Seine to Versailles.</p>

Seville oranges. The &ldquo;marmalade-tree&rdquo; (<i>Lucuma mammosa</i>)
bears a fruit whose thick pulp resembles marmalade and is

<p><span class="bold">MARMANDE,<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> a town of south-western France, capital of
an arrondissement in the department of Lot-et-Garonne, 35 m.
N.W. of Agen, on the Southern railway from Bordeaux to Cette.
Pop. (1906), town 6373; commune, 9748. Marmande is situated
at the confluence of the Trec with the Garonne on the right bank
of the latter river, which is here crossed by a suspension bridge.
Public institutions include the sub-prefecture, the tribunals of
first instance and commerce, the communal college and schools
of commerce and industry and of agriculture. Apart from
the administrative offices, the only building of importance is
the church of Nôtre-Dame, which dates from the 13th, 14th and
15th centuries. The graceful windows of the nave, the altarpiece
of the 18th century, and in particular, the Renaissance
cloister adjoining the south side, are its most interesting features.
Among the industries are iron-founding, steam sawing, the
manufacture of woollens, carriage-making, cooperage and
brandy-distilling. There is a large trade in wine, plums, cattle,
grain and other agricultural produce.</p>

<p>Marmande was a <i>bastide</i> founded about 1195 on the site of a
more ancient town by Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion, who granted it
a liberal measure of self-government. Its position on the banks
of the Garonne made it an important place of toll. It soon
passed into the hands of the counts of Toulouse, and was three
times besieged and taken during the Albigensian crusade, its
capture by Amaury de Montfort in 1219 being followed by a
massacre of the inhabitants. It was united to the French crown
under Louis IX. A short occupation by the English in 1447,
an unsuccessful siege by Henry IV. in 1577 and its resistance of
a month to a division of Wellington&rsquo;s army in 1814, are the chief
events in its subsequent history.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARMIER, XAVIER<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> (1809-1892), French author, was born
at Pontarlier, in Doubs, on the 24th of June 1809. He had a
passion for travelling, and this he combined throughout his life
with the production of literature. After journeying in Switzerland,
Belgium and Holland, he was attached in 1835 to the Arctic
expedition of the &ldquo;Recherche&rdquo;; and after a couple of years at
Rennes as professor of foreign literature, he visited (1842) Russia,
(1845) Syria, (1846) Algeria, (1848-1849) North and South
America, and numerous volumes from his pen were the result. In
1870 he was elected to the Academy, and he was for many years
prominently identified with the Sainte-Geneviève library. He
did much to encourage the study of Scandinavian literature in
France, publishing translations of Holberg, Oehlenschläger and
others. He died in Paris on the 11th of October 1892.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARMONT, AUGUSTE FRÉDÉRIC LOUIS VIESSE DE,<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> <span class="sc">Duke
of Ragusa</span> (1774-1852), marshal of France, was born at Châtillon-sur-Seine,
on the 20th of July 1774. He was the son of an ex-officer
in the army who belonged to the <i>petite noblesse</i> and adopted
the principles of the Revolution. His love of soldiering soon
showing itself, his father took him to Dijon to learn mathematics
prior to entering the artillery, and there he made the acquaintance
of Bonaparte, which he renewed after obtaining his commission
when he served in Toulon. The acquaintance ripened
into intimacy; Marmont became General Bonaparte&rsquo;s aide-de-camp,
remained with him during his disgrace and accompanied
him to Italy and Egypt, winning distinction and promotion to
general of brigade. In 1799 he returned to Europe with his
chief; he was present at the <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> of the 18th Brumaire, and
organized the artillery for the expedition to Italy, which he
commanded with great effect at Marengo. For this he was at
once made general of division. In 1801 he became inspector-general
of artillery, and in 1804 grand officer of the Legion of
Honour, but was greatly disappointed at being omitted from
the list of officers who were made marshals. In 1805 he received
the command of a corps, with which he did good service at Ulm.
He was then directed to take possession of Dalmatia with his
army, and occupied Ragusa. For the next five years he was
military and civil governor of Dalmatia, and traces of his beneficent
régime still survive both in great public works and in the
memories of the people. In 1808 he was made duke of Ragusa,
and in 1809, being summoned by Napoleon to take part in the
Austrian War, he marched to Vienna and bore a share in the
closing operations of the campaign. Napoleon now made him
a marshal and governor-general of all the Illyrian provinces
of the empire. In July 1810 Marmont was hastily summoned
to succeed Masséna in the command of the French army in the
north of Spain. The skill with which he man&oelig;uvred his army
during the year he commanded it has been always acknowledged.
His relief of Ciudad Rodrigo in the autumn of 1811 in spite of the
presence of the English army was a great feat, and in the
man&oelig;uvring which preceded the battle of Salamanca he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page745" id="page745"></a>745</span>
the best of it. But Wellington more than retrieved his position
in the battle (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Salamanca</a></span>), and inflicted a severe defeat
on the French, Marmont himself being gravely wounded in the
right arm and side. He retired to France to recover, and was
still hardly cured when in April 1813 Napoleon, who soon forgot
his fleeting resentment for the defeat, gave him the command
of a corps. With it he served at the battles of Lützen, Bautzen
and Dresden, and throughout the great defensive campaign of
1814 until the last battle before Paris, from which he drew back
his forces to the commanding position of Essonne. Here he had
20,000 men in hand, and was the pivot of all thoughts. Napoleon
said of this camp of Essonne, &ldquo;C&rsquo;est là que viendront s&rsquo;addresser
toutes les intrigues, toutes les trahisons; aussi y ai-je placé
Marmont, mon enfant élevé sous ma tente.&rdquo; Marmont then took
upon himself a political rôle which has, no doubt justly, been
stigmatized as ungrateful and treasonable. A secret convention
was concluded, and Marmont&rsquo;s corps was surrounded by the
enemy. Napoleon, who still hoped to retain the crown for his
infant son, was prostrated, and said with a sadness deeper than
violent words, &ldquo;Marmont me porte le dernier coup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This act was never forgiven by Marmont&rsquo;s countrymen. On
the restoration of the Bourbons he was indeed made a peer of
France and a major-general of the royal guard, and in 1820
a knight of the Saint Esprit and a grand officer of the order of
St Louis; but he was never trusted. He was the major-general
of the guard on duty in July 1830, and was ordered to put down
with a strong hand any opposition to the ordinances (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">France</a></span>).
Himself opposed to the court policy, he yet tried to do his duty,
and only gave up the attempt to suppress the revolution when
it became clear that his troops were outmatched. This brought
more obloquy upon him, and the duc d&rsquo;Angoulême even ordered
him under arrest, saying, &ldquo;Will you betray us, as you betrayed
him?&rdquo; Marmont did not betray them; he accompanied the
king into exile and forfeited his marshalate thereby. His desire
to return to France was never gratified and he wandered in
central and eastern Europe, settling finally in Vienna, where he
was well received by the Austrian government, and strange to
say made tutor to the duke of Reichstadt, the young man who
had once for a few weeks been styled Napoleon II. He died
at Venice on the 22nd of March 1852.</p>

<p>Much of his time in his last years was spent upon his <i>Mémoires</i>,
which are of great value for the military history of his time,
though they must be read as a personal defence of himself in
various junctures rather than as an unbiased account of his
times. They show Marmont, as he really was, an embittered
man, who never thought his services sufficiently requited, and
above all, a man too much in love with himself and his own glory
to be a true friend or a faithful servant. His strategy indeed
tended to become pure virtuosity, and his tactics, though neat,
appear frigid and antiquated when contrasted with those of the
instinctive leaders, the fighting generals whom the theorists
affect to despise. But his military genius is undeniable, and he
was as far superior to the mere theorist as Lannes and Davout
were to the pure <i>divisionnaire</i> or &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; general.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARMONTEL, JEAN FRANÇOIS<a name="ar177" id="ar177"></a></span> (1723-1799), French writer,
was born of poor parents at Bort, in Cantal, on the 11th of July
1723. After studying with the Jesuits at Mauriac, he taught
in their colleges at Clermont and Toulouse; and in 1745, acting
on the advice of Voltaire, he set out for Paris to try for literary
honours. From 1748 to 1753 he wrote a succession of tragedies
which,<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> though only moderately successful on the stage, secured
the admission of the author to literary and fashionable circles.
He wrote for the <i>Encyclopédie</i> a series of articles evincing considerable
critical power and insight, which in their collected form,
under the title <i>Éléments de Littérature</i>, still rank among the French
classics. He also wrote several comic operas, the two best of
which probably are <i>Sylvain</i> (1770) and <i>Zémire et Azore</i> (1771).
In the Gluck-Piccini controversy he was an eager partisan of
Piccini with whom he collaborated in <i>Didon</i> (1783) and <i>Pénélope</i>
(1785). In 1758 he gained the patronage of Madame de Pompadour,
who obtained for him a place as a civil servant, and the
management of the official journal <i>Le Mercure</i>, in which he had
already begun the famous series of <i>Contes moraux</i>. The merit
of these tales lies partly in the delicate finish of the style, but
mainly in the graphic and charming pictures of French society
under Louis XV. The author was elected to the French Academy
in 1763. In 1767 he published a romance, <i>Bélisaire</i>, now remarkable
only on account of a chapter on religious toleration which
incurred the censure of the Sorbonne and the archbishop of
Paris. Marmontel retorted in <i>Les Incas</i> (1778) by tracing the
cruelties in Spanish America to the religious fanaticism of the
invaders.</p>

<p>He was appointed historiographer of France (1771), secretary
to the Academy (1783), and professor of history in the Lycée
(1786). In his character of historiographer Marmontel wrote
a history of the regency (1788) which is of little value. Reduced
to poverty by the Revolution, Marmontel in 1792 retired during
the Terror to Evreux, and soon after to a cottage at Abloville
in the department of Eure. To that retreat we owe his <i>Mémoires
d&rsquo;un père</i> (4 vols., 1804) giving a picturesque review of his whole
life, a literary history of two important reigns, a great gallery
of portraits extending from the venerable Massillon, whom more
than half a century previously he had seen at Clermont, to
Mirabeau. The book was nominally written for the instruction
of his children. It contains an exquisitely drawn picture of his
own childhood in the Limousin; its value for the literary historian
is very great. Marmontel lived for some time under the roof of
Mme Geoffrin, and was present at her famous dinners given to
artists; he was, indeed, an <i>habitué</i> of most of the houses where
the encyclopaedists met. He had thus at his command the best
material for his portraits, and made good use of his opportunities.
After a short stay in Paris when elected in 1797 to the Conseil
des Anciens, he died on the 31st of December 1799 at Abloville.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page746" id="page746"></a>746</span>

<p><span class="bold">MARMOT,<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> the vernacular name of a large, thickly built,
burrowing Alpine rodent mammal, allied to the squirrels, and
typifying the genus <i>Arctomys</i>, of which there are numerous
species ranging from the Alps through Asia north of (but including
the inner ranges of) the Himalaya, and recurring in North
America. All these may be included under the name marmot.
In addition to their stout build and long thickly haired tails,
marmots are characterized by the absence of cheek-pouches, and
the rudimentary first front-toe, which is furnished with a flat
nail, as well as by certain features of the skull and cheek-teeth.
Europe possesses two species, the Alpine or true marmot
(<i>A. marmotta</i>), and the more eastern bobac (<i>A. bobac</i>); and there
are numerous kinds in Central Asia, one of which, the red marmot
(<i>A. caudata</i>), is a much larger animal, with a longer tail. Marmots
inhabit open country, either among mountains, or, more to the
north, in the plains; and associate in large colonies, forming
burrows, each tenanted by a single family. During the daytime
the hillock at the entrance to the burrow is frequently
occupied by one or more members of the family, which at the
approach of strangers sit up on their hind-legs in order to get a
better view. If alarmed they utter a shrill loud whistle, and
rush down the burrow, but reappear after a few minutes to see if
the danger is past. In the winter when the ground is deep in
snow, marmots retire to the depths of their burrows, where as
many as ten or fifteen may occupy the same chamber. No
store of food is accumulated, and the winter sleep is probably
unbroken. From two to four is the usual number of young in a
litter. In America marmots are known as &ldquo;wood-chucks&rdquo;
(<i>q.v.</i>), the commonest species being <i>A. monax</i>. The so-called
prairie-dogs, which are smaller and more slender North American
rodents with small cheek-pouches, form a separate genus,
<i>Cynomys</i>; while the term pouched-marmots denotes the
various species of souslik (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>Spermophilus</i> (or <i>Citillus</i>),
which are common to both hemispheres, and distinguished by
the presence of large cheek-pouches (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rodentia</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARNE,<a name="ar182" id="ar182"></a></span> a river of northern France, rising on the Plateau of
Langres, 3 m. S. by E. of Langres, and uniting with the Seine at
Charenton, an eastern suburb of Paris. Leaving Langres on
the left the river flows northward, passing Chaumont, as far as
a point a little above St Dizier. Here it turns west and enters
the department of Marne, where it waters the Perthois and the
wide plain of Champagne-Pouilleuse. Soon after its entrance
into this department it receives the Blaise; and turning north-west
passes Vitry-le-François where it receives the Saulx,
Châlons, below which it resumes a westerly course, and Epernay,
where it enters picturesque and undulating country. Its subsequent
course lies through the departments of Aisne, where it
flows through Chateau-Thierry; Seine-et-Marne, where it drives
the picturesque mills of Meaux; Seine-et-Oise and Seine. Its
chief tributaries in those departments are the Petit-Morin, the
Ourcq and the Grand-Morin. The length of the Marne is 328 m.,
the area of its basin 4894 sq. m. It is joined a mile from
its source of the Marne-Saône canal which is continued at
Rouvroy by the Haute-Marne canal as far as Vitry-le-François.
From that town, which is the starting-point of the canal between
the Marne and the Rhine, it is accompanied by the lateral canal
of the Marne to Dizy where its own channel is canalized. At
Condé, above Epernay, the river is joined by the canal connecting
it with the Aisne. From Lizy, above Meaux, it is accompanied
on the right bank, though at some distance, by the Ourcq canal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARNE,<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> a department of north-eastern France, made up from
Champagne-Pouilleuse, Rémois, Haute-Champagne, Perthois,
Tardenois, Bocage and Brie-Pouilleuse, districts formerly belonging
to Champagne, and bounded W. by Seine-et-Marne and
Aisne, N. by Aisne and Ardennes, E. by Meuse, and S. by Haute-Marne
and Aube. Pop. (1906), 434,157. Area 3167 sq. m.</p>

<p>About one-half consists of Champagne-Pouilleuse, a monotonous
and barren plain covering a bed of chalk 1300 ft. in thickness.
On the west and on the east it is commanded by two
ranges of hills. The highest point in the department (920 ft.) is
in the hill district of Reims, which rises to the south-west of the
town of the same name, between the Vesle and the Marne. The
lowest level (164 ft.) where the Aisne leaves the department, is
not far distant. To the south of the Marne the hills of Reims are
continued by the heights of Brie (700 to 800 ft.). All these belong
geologically to the basin of Paris. They slope gently towards
the west, but command the plain of Champagne-Pouilleuse by a
steep descent on the east. On the farther side of the plain are
the heights of Argonne (860 ft.) formed of beds of the Lower
Chalk, and covered by forests; they unite the calcareous formations
of Langres to the schists of Ardennes, and a continuation of
them stretches southward into Perthois and the marshy Bocage.
The department belongs entirely to the Seine basin, but includes
only 13 miles of that river, in the south-west; it there receives the
Aube, which flows for 10 miles within the department. The
principal river is the Marne, which runs through the department
for 105 miles in a great sweep concave to the south-west. The
Aisne enters the department at a point 12 miles from its source,
and traverses it for 37 miles. Two of its affluents on the left,
the Suippes and the Vesle, on which stands Reims, have a longer
course from south-east to north-west across the department.</p>

<p>Marne has the temperate climate of the region of the Seine;
the annual mean temperature is 50° F., the rainfall about
24 in. Oats, wheat, rye and barley among the cereals, lucerne,
sainfoin and clover, and potatoes, mangold-wurzels and sugar-beet
are the principal agricultural crops. The raising of sheep
of a mixed merino breed and of other stock together with bee-farming
are profitable. The vineyards, concentrated chiefly
round Reims and Épernay, are of high value; the manufacture
of the sparkling Champagne wines being a highly important
industry, of which Épernay, Reims and Châlons are the chief
centres. Several communes supply the more valuable vegetables,
such as asparagus, onions, &amp;c. The principal orchard fruits are
the apple, plum and cherry. Pine woods are largely planted
in Champagne-Pouilleuse. The department produces peat,
millstones and chalk.</p>

<p>The woollen industry has brought together in the neighbourhood
of Reims establishments for spinning, carding, dyeing and
weaving. The materials wrought are flannels, merinoes,
tartans, shawls, rugs and fancy articles; the manufacture of
woollen and cotton hosiery must also be mentioned. The
manufacture of wine-cases, corks, casks and other goods for
the wine trade is actively carried on. Marne contains blast-furnaces,
iron and copper foundries, and manufactories of
agricultural implements. Besides these there are tan-yards,
currying and leather-dressing establishments and glassworks,
which, with sugar, chemical, whiting and oil works, potteries,
flour-mills and breweries, complete the list of the most important
industries. Biscuits and gingerbread are a speciality of Reims.
The chief imports are wool and coal; the exports are wine,
grain, live-stock, stone, whiting, pit-props and woollen stuffs.
Communication is afforded chiefly by the river Marne with
its canal connexions, and by the Eastern railway. There are
five arrondissements&mdash;those of Châlons (the capital), Épernay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page747" id="page747"></a>747</span>
Reims, Ste Ménehould and Vitry-le-François&mdash;with 33 cantons
and 662 communes. The department belongs partly to the
archbishopric of Reims and partly to the see of Châlons.
Châlons is the headquarters of the VI. army corps. Its educational
centre and court of appeal are at Paris. The principal towns&mdash;Châlons-sur-Marne,
Reims, Épernay and Vitry-le-François&mdash;are
separately treated. The towns next in population are
Ay (4994) and Sézanne (4504). Other places of interest are
Ste Ménehould (3348), formerly an important fortress and
capital of the Argonne; Montmort with a Renaissance château
once the property of Sully; Trois-Fontaines with a ruined church
of the 12th century and the remains of a Cistercian abbey
founded in 1115; and Orbais with an abbey church dating from
about 1200.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAROCHETTI, CARLO,<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1805-1867), Italian sculptor,
was born at Turin. Most of his early life was spent in
France, his first systematic instruction being given him by
Bosio and Gros in Paris. Here his statue of &ldquo;A Young Girl
playing with a Dog&rdquo; won a medal in 1829. But between
1822 and 1830 he studied chiefly in Rome. From 1832 to 1848
he lived in France. His &ldquo;Fallen Angel&rdquo; was exhibited in 1831.
In 1848 Marochetti removed to London, and there he lived
for the greater part of his time till his death in 1867. Among
his chief works were statues of Queen Victoria, Lord Clyde
(the obelisk in Waterloo Place), Richard C&oelig;ur-de-Lion (Westminster),
Emmanuel Philibert (1833, Turin), the tomb of Bellini
(Père-la-Chaise), and the altar in the Madeleine. His style
was vigorous and effective, but rather popular than artistic.
Marochetti, who was created a baron by the king of Sardinia,
was also a chevalier of the Legion of Honour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARONITES<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> (Arab. <i>Mawarina</i>), a Christian people of the
Ottoman Empire in communion with the Papal Church, but
forming a distinct denomination. The original seat and present
home of the nucleus of the Maronites is Mt Lebanon; but they
are also to be found in considerable force in Anti-Lebanon
and Hermon, and more sporadically in and near Antioch, in
Galilee, and on the Syrian coast. Colonies exist in Cyprus
(with a large convent near Cape Kormakiti), in Alexandria,
and in the United States of America. These began to be formed
during the troubles of 1860. The Lebanon community numbers
about 300,000, and the total of the whole denomination cannot
be much under half a million.</p>

<p>The origin of Maronism has been much obscured by the
efforts of learned Maronites like Yusuf as-Simani (Assemanus),
Vatican librarian under Clement XII., Faustus Nairon, Gabriel
Sionita and Abraham Ecchellensis to clear its history from
all taint of heresy. We are told of an early Antiochene, Mar
Marun or Maro, who died about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 400 in the odour of sanctity
in a convent at Ribla on the Orontes, whence orthodoxy spread
over mid-Syria. But nothing sure is known of him, and not much
more about a more historical personage, Yuhanna Marun (John
Sirimensis of Suedia), said to have been patriarch of Antioch, to
have converted Lebanon from Monothelism, and to have died
in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 707. It is, however, certain that the Lebanon Christians
as a whole were not orthodox in the time of Justinian II.,
against whose supporters, the Melkites, they ranged themselves
after having co-operated awhile with the emperor against the
Moslems. They were then called Mardaites or rebels, and
were mainly Monothelite in the 12th century, and remained
largely so even a century later. The last two facts are attested
by William of Tyre and Barhebraeus. It seems most probable
that the Lebanon offered refuge to Antiochene Monothelites flying
from the ban of the Constantinopolitan Council of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 680;
that these converted part of the old mountain folk, who already
held some kind of Incarnationist creed; and that their first
patriarch and his successors, for about 500 years at any rate,
were Monothelite, and perhaps also Monophysite. It is worth
noting that even as late as the close of the 16th century the
Maronite patriarch found it necessary to protest by anathema
against imputations of heresy. In 1182 it is said that Amaury,
patriarch of Antioch, induced some Maronite bishops, who had
fallen under crusading influences, to rally to Rome; and a
definite acceptance of the Maronite Church into the Roman
communion took place at the Council of Florence in 1445.
But it is evident that the local particularism of the Lebanon
was adverse to this union, and that even Gregory XIII., who sent
the <i>pallium</i> to the patriarch Michael, and Clement VII. who
in 1596 dispatched a mission to a synod convoked at Kannobin,
the old patriarchal residence, did not prevail on the lower
clergy or the mass of the Maronites. A century and a half
later Clement XII. was more successful. He sent to Syria,
Assemanus, a Maronite educated at the Roman college of
Gregory XIII.; and at last, at a council held at the monastery
of Lowaizi on the 30th of September 1736, the Maronite Church
accepted from Rome a constitution which is still in force, and
agreed to abandon some of its more incongruous usages such
as mixed convents of monks and nuns. It retained, however,
its Syriac liturgy and a non-celibate priesthood. The former
still persists unchanged, while the Bible is read and exhortations
are given in Arabic; and priests may still be ordained after
marriage. But marriage is not permitted subsequent to ordination,
nor does it any longer usually precede it. The tendency
to a celibate clergy increases, together with other romanizing
usages, promoted by the papal legate in Beirut, the Catholic
missioners, and the higher native clergy who are usually educated
in Rome or at St Sulpice. The legate exercises growing
influence on patriarchal and other elections, and on Church
government and discipline. The patriarch receives confirmation
from Rome, and the political representation of the Maronites
at Constantinople is in the hands of the vicar apostolic. Rome
has incorporated most of the Maronite saints in her calendar,
while refusing (despite their apologists) to canonize either of the
reputed eponymous founders of Maronism.</p>

<p>While retaining many local usages, the Maronite Church
does not differ now in anything essential from the Papal,
either in dogma or practice. It has, like the Greek Church,
two kinds of clergy&mdash;parochial and monastic. The former
are supported by their parishes; the latter by the revenues of
the monasteries, which own about one-sixth of the Lebanon
lands. There are some 1400 monks in about 120 monastic
establishments (many of these being mere farms in charge of
one or two monks). All are of the order of St Anthony, but
divided into three congregations, the Ishaya, the Halebiyeh
(Aleppine) and the Beladiyeh or Libnaniyeh (local). The
distinction of the last named dates only from the early 18th
century. The lower clergy are educated at the theological
college of Ain Warka. There are five archbishoprics and five
bishoprics under the patriarch, who alone can consecrate. The
sees are Aleppo, Baalbek, Tripoli, Ehden, Damascus, Beirut,
Tyre, Cyprus and Jebeil (held by the patriarch himself <i>ex officio</i>).
There are also four prelates <i>in partibus</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Maronites are most numerous and unmixed in the north
of Lebanon (districts of Bsherreh and Kesrawan). Formerly
they were wholly organized on a clan system under feudal chiefs,
of whom those of the house of Khazin were the most powerful;
and these fought among themselves rather than with the Druses
or other denominations down to the 18th century, when the Arab
family of Shehab for its own purposes began to stir up strife between
Maronites and Druses (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Druses</a></span>). Feudalism died hard, but
since 1860 has been practically extinct; and so far as the Maronites
own a chief of their own people it is the &ldquo;Patriarch of Antioch and
the whole East,&rdquo; who resides at Bkerkeh near Beirut in winter,
and at a hill station (Bdiman or Raifun) in summer. The latter,
however, has no recognized jurisdiction except over his clergy.
The Maronites have four members on the provincial council, two
of whom are the sole representatives of the two <i>mudirats</i> of Kesrawan;
and they have derived benefit from the fact that so far the
governor of the privileged province has always been a Catholic
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lebanon</a></span>). The French protection of them, which dates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page748" id="page748"></a>748</span>
from Louis XIV., is no longer operative but to French official
representatives is still accorded a courteous precedence. The
Maronite population has greatly increased at the expense of the
Druses, and is now obliged to emigrate in considerable numbers.
Increase of wealth and the influence of returned emigrants tend to
soften Maronite character, and the last remnants of the barbarous
state of the community&mdash;even the obstinate blood-feud&mdash;are
disappearing.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAROT, CLÉMENT<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> (1496-1544), French poet, was born
at Cahors, the capital of the province of Quercy, some time
during the winter of the year 1496-1497. His father, Jean Marot
(<i>c.</i> 1463-1523), whose more correct name appears to have been
des Mares, Marais or Marets, was a Norman of the neighbourhood
of Caen. Jean was himself a poet of considerable merit, and
held the post of <i>escripvain</i> (apparently uniting the duties of
poet laureate and historiographer) to Anne of Brittany. He
had however resided in Cahors for a considerable time, and was
twice married there, his second wife being the mother of Clément.
The boy was &ldquo;brought into France&rdquo;&mdash;it is his own expression,
and is not unnoteworthy as showing the strict sense in which
that term was still used at the beginning of the 16th century&mdash;in
1506, and he appears to have been educated at the university
of Paris, and to have then begun the study of law. But,
whereas most other poets have had to cultivate poetry against
their father&rsquo;s will, Jean Marot took great pains to instruct his
son in the fashionable forms of verse-making, which indeed
required not a little instruction. It was the palmy time of the
<i>rhétoriqueurs</i>, poets who combined stilted and pedantic language
with an obstinate adherence to the allegorical manner of the
15th century and to the most complicated and artificial forms
of the <i>ballade</i> and the <i>rondeau</i>. Clément himself practised
with diligence this poetry (which he was to do more than any
other man to overthrow), and he has left panegyrics of its
coryphaeus Guillaume Crétin, the supposed original of the
Raminagrobis of Rabelais, while he translated Virgil&rsquo;s first
eclogue in 1512. Nor did he long continue even a nominal
devotion to law. He became page to Nicolas de Neuville,
seigneur de Villeroy, and this opened to him the way to court
life. Besides this, his father&rsquo;s interest must have been not
inconsiderable, and the house of Valois, which was about to
hold the throne of France for the greater part of a century,
was devoted to letters.</p>

<p>As early as 1514, before the accession of Francis I., Clément
presented to him his <i>Judgment of Minos</i>, and shortly afterwards
he was either styled or styled himself <i>facteur</i> (poet) <i>de la reine</i>
to Queen Claude. In 1519 he was attached to the suite of
Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoulême, the king&rsquo;s sister, who was for many
years to be the mainstay not only of him but of almost all
French men of letters. He was also a great favourite of Francis
himself, attended the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and
duly celebrated it in verse. Next year he was at the camp
in Flanders, and writes of the horrors of war. It is certain
that Marot, like most of Marguerite&rsquo;s literary court, and perhaps
more than most of them, was greatly attracted by her gracious
ways, her unfailing kindness, and her admirable intellectual
accomplishments, but there is not the slightest ground for
thinking that his attachment was other than platonic. It is,
however, evident that at this time either sentiment or matured
critical judgment effected a great change in his style, a
change which was wholly for the better. At the same time he
celebrates a certain Diane, whom it has been sought to identify
with Diane de Poitiers. There is nothing to support this idea
and much against it, for it was an almost invariable habit of
the poets of the 16th century, when the mistresses whom they
celebrated were flesh and blood at all (which was not always
the case), to celebrate them under pseudonyms. In the same
year, 1524, Marot accompanied Francis on his disastrous Italian
campaign. He was wounded and taken at Pavia, but soon
released, and he was back again at Paris by the beginning of 1525.
His luck had, however, turned. Marguerite for intellectual
reasons, and her brother for political, had hitherto favoured
the double movement of <i>Aufklärung</i>, partly humanist, partly
Reforming, which distinguished the beginning of the century.
Formidable opposition to both forms of innovation, however, now
began to be manifested, and Marot, who was at no time particularly
prudent, was arrested on a charge of heresy and lodged
in the Châtelet, February 1526. But this was only a foretaste of
the coming trouble, and a friendly prelate, acting for Marguerite,
extricated him from his durance before Easter. The imprisonment
gave him occasion to write a vigorous poem on it entitled
<i>Enfer</i>, which was afterwards imitated by his luckless friend
Étienne Dolet. His father died about this time, and Marot
seems to have been appointed to the place which Jean had
latterly enjoyed, that of valet de chambre to the king. He
was certainly a member of the royal household in 1528 with a
stipend of 250 livres, besides which he had inherited property in
Quercy. In 1530, probably, he married. Next year he was again
in trouble, not it is said for heresy, but for attempting to rescue
a prisoner, and was again delivered; this time the king and
queen of Navarre seem to have bailed him themselves.</p>

<p>In 1532 he published (it had perhaps appeared three years
earlier), under the title of <i>Adolescence Clémentine</i>, a title the
characteristic grace of which excuses its slight savour of affectation,
the first printed collection of his works, which was very
popular and was frequently reprinted with additions. Dolet&rsquo;s
edition of 1538 is believed to be the most authoritative. Unfortunately,
however, the poet&rsquo;s enemies were by no means
discouraged by their previous ill-success, and the political
situation was very unfavourable to the Reforming party.
In 1535 Marot was implicated in the affair of &ldquo;The Placards,&rdquo;<a name="fa1o" id="fa1o" href="#ft1o"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
and this time he was advised or thought it best to fly. He
passed through Béarn, and then made his way to Renée, duchess
of Ferrara, a supporter of the French reformers as steadfast
as her aunt Marguerite, and even more efficacious, because
her dominions were out of France. At Ferrara he wrote a
good deal, his work there including his celebrated <i>Blasons</i> (a
descriptive poem, improved upon medieval models<a name="fa2o" id="fa2o" href="#ft2o"><span class="sp">2</span></a>), which set
all the verse-writers of France imitating them. But the
duchess Renée was not able to persuade her husband, Ercole
d&rsquo;Este, to share her views, and Marot had to quit the city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page749" id="page749"></a>749</span>
He then went to Venice, but before very long the pope Paul III.
remonstrated with Francis I. on the severity with which the
Protestants were treated, and they were allowed to return to
Paris on condition of recanting their errors. Marot returned
with the rest, and abjured his heresy at Lyons. In 1539
Francis gave him a house and grounds in the suburbs.</p>

<p>It was at this time that his famous translations of the Psalms
appeared. The merit of these has been sometimes denied,
it is, however, considerable, and the powerful influence which
the book exercised on contemporaries is not denied by anyone.
The great persons of the court chose different pieces, each as
his or her favourite. They were sung in court and city,
and they are said, with exaggeration doubtless, but still with a
basis of truth, to have done more than anything else to advance
the cause of the Reformation in France. Indeed, the vernacular
prose translations of the Scriptures were in that country of little
merit or power, and the form of poetry was still preferred
to prose, even for the most incongruous subjects. At the same
time Marot engaged in a curious literary quarrel characteristic
of the time, with a bad poet named Sagon, who represented
the reactionary Sorbonne. Half the verse-writers of France
ranged themselves among the Marotiques or the Sagontiques,
and a great deal of versified abuse was exchanged. The victory,
as far as wit was concerned, naturally rested with Marot, but his
biographers are probably not fanciful in supposing that a certain
amount of odium was created against him by the squabble,
and that, as in Dolet&rsquo;s case, his subsequent misfortunes were
not altogether unconnected with a too little governed tongue
and pen.</p>

<p>The publication of the Psalms gave the Sorbonne a handle,
and the book was condemned by that body. In 1543 it was
evident that he could not rely on the protection of Francis.
Marot accordingly fled to Geneva; but the stars were now
decidedly against him. He had, like most of his friends, been
at least as much of a freethinker as of a Protestant, and this
was fatal to his reputation in the austere city of Calvin. He
had again to fly, and made his way into Piedmont, and he died
at Turin in the autumn of 1544.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In character Marot seems to have been a typical Frenchman of
the old stamp, cheerful, good-humoured and amiable enough, but
probably not very much disposed to elaborately moral life and
conversation or to serious reflection. He has sometimes been charged
with a want of independence of character; but it is fair to remember
that in the middle ages men of letters naturally attached themselves
as dependants to the great. Such scanty knowledge as we
have of his relations with his equals is favourable to him. He
certainly at one time quarrelled with Dolet, or at least wrote a
violent epigram against him, for which there is no known cause.
But, as Dolet quarrelled with almost every friend he ever had, and
in two or three cases played them the shabbiest of tricks, the presumption
is not against Marot in this matter. With other poets
like Mellin de Saint Gelais and Brodeau, with prose writers like
Rabelais and Bonaventure Desperiers, he was always on excellent
terms. And whatever may have been his personal weaknesses,
his importance in the history of French literature is very great,
and was long rather under than over-valued. Coming immediately
before a great literary reform&mdash;that of the Pléiade&mdash;Marot suffered
the drawbacks of his position; he was both eclipsed and decried by
the partakers in that reform. In the reaction against the Pléiade
he recovered honour; but its restoration to virtual favour, a perfectly
just restoration, again unjustly depressed him. Yet Marot
is in no sense one of those writers of transition who are rightly
obscured by those who come after them. He himself was a reformer,
and a reformer on perfectly independent lines, and he carried his
own reform as far as it would go. His early work was couched in
the <i>rhétoriqueur</i> style, the distinguishing characteristics of which
are elaborate metre and rhyme, allegoric matter and pedantic
language. In his second stage he entirely emancipated himself
from this, and became one of the easiest, least affected and most
vernacular poets of France. In these points indeed he has, with
the exception of La Fontaine, no rival, and the lighter verse-writers
ever since have taken one or the other or both as model. In his
third period he lost a little of this flowing grace and ease, but acquired
something in stateliness, while he certainly lost nothing in
wit. Marot is the first poet who strikes readers of French as being
distinctively modern. He is not so great a poet as Villon nor as
some of his successors of the Pléiade, but he is much less antiquated
than the first (whose works, as well as the <i>Roman de la rose</i>, it may
be well to mention that he edited) and not so elaborately artificial
as the second. Indeed if there be a fault to find with Marot, it is
undoubtedly that in his gallant and successful effort to break up,
supple, and liquefy the stiff forms and stiffer language of the 15th
century, he made his poetry almost too vernacular and pedestrian.
He <i>has</i> passion, and picturesqueness, but rarely; in his hands, and
while the <i>style Marotique</i> was supreme, French poetry ran some
risk of finding itself unequal to anything but graceful <i>vers de société</i>.
But it is only fair to remember that for a century and more its
best achievements, with rare exceptions, had been <i>vers de société</i>
which were not graceful.</p>

<p>The most important early editions of Marot&rsquo;s <i>&OElig;uvres</i> are those
published at Lyons in 1538 and 1544. In the second of these the
arrangement of his poems which has been accepted in later issues
was first adopted. In 1596 an enlarged edition was edited by
François Mizière. Others of later date are those of N. Lenglet du
Fresnoy (the Hague, 1731) and P. Jannet (1868-1872; new ed.,
1873-1876), on the whole the best, but there is a very good selection
with a still better introduction by Charles d&rsquo;Héricault, the joint
editor of the Jannet edition in the larger <i>Collection Garnier</i> (no
date). An elaborate edition by G. Guiffrey remained incomplete,
only vols. ii. and iii. (1875-1881) having been issued. For information
about Marot himself see <i>Notices biographiques des trois
Marot</i>, edited from the MS. of Guillaume Colletet by G. Guiffrey

<p><span class="bold">MAROT, DANIEL<a name="ar190" id="ar190"></a></span> (seventeenth century), French architect,
furniture designer and engraver, and pupil of Jean le Pautre
(<i>q.v.</i>), was the son of Jean Marot (1620-1679), who was also an
architect and engraver. He was a Huguenot, and was compelled
by the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 to settle in
Holland. His earlier work is characteristic of the second period
of Louis XIV., but eventually it became tinged with Dutch
influence, and in the end the English style which is loosely
called &ldquo;Queen Anne&rdquo; owed much to his manner. In Holland
he was taken almost immediately into the service of the Stadtholder,
who, when he shortly afterwards became William III.
of England, appointed him one of his architects and master
of the works. Comparatively little is known of his architectural
achievements, and his name cannot be attached to any English
building, although we know from his own engraving that he
designed the great hall of audience for the States-General at
the Hague. He also decorated many Dutch country-houses.
In England his activities appear to have been concentrated
upon the adornment of Hampton Court Palace. Among his plans
for gardens is one inscribed: &ldquo;Parterre d&rsquo;Amton-court inventé
par D. Marot.&rdquo; Much of the furniture&mdash;especially the mirrors,
guéridons and beds&mdash;at Hampton Court bears unmistakable
traces of his authorship; the tall and monumental beds, with
their plumes of ostrich feathers, their elaborate valances and
<i>chantournes</i> in crimson velvet or other rich stuffs agree very
closely with his published designs. As befits an artist of the
time of Louis XIV. splendour and elaboration are the outstanding
characteristics of Marot&rsquo;s style, and he appears even
to have been responsible for some of the curious and rather
barbaric silver furniture which was introduced into England
from France in the latter part of the 17th century. At Windsor
Castle there is a silver table, attributed to him, supported by
caryatid legs and gadrooned feet, with a foot-rail supporting
the pine-apple which is so familiar a motive in work of this
type. The slab is engraved with the arms of William III.
and with the British national emblems with crowns and cherubs.
Unquestionably it is an exceedingly fine example of its type.
During his life in France Marot made many designs for André
Charles Boulle (<i>q.v.</i>), more especially for long case and bracket
clocks. The bracket clocks were intended to be mounted in
chased and gilded bronze, and with their garlands and masquerons
and elegant dials are far superior artistically to those of
the &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; variety. It is impossible to examine the
designs for Marot&rsquo;s long clocks without suspecting that Chippendale
derived from them some at least of the inspiration which
made him a master of that kind of furniture. Marot&rsquo;s range
was extraordinarily wide. He designed practically every detail
in the internal ornamentation of the house&mdash;carved chimney-pieces,
ceilings, panels for walls, girandoles and wall brackets,
and even tea urns and cream jugs&mdash;he was indeed a prolific
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page750" id="page750"></a>750</span>
designer of gold and silver plate. Many of his interiors are
very rich and harmonious although commonly over-elaborated.
The craze for collecting china which was at its height in his time
is illustrated in his lavish designs for receptacles for porcelain&mdash;in
one of his plates there are more than 300 pieces of china on
the chimney-piece alone. Marot was still living in 1718, and
the date of his death is unknown.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>We owe much of our knowledge of his work to the volume of
his designs published at Amsterdam in 1712: <i>&OElig;uvres du Sieur
D. Marot, architecte de Guillaume III. Roi de la Grande Bretagne</i>,
and to <i>Receuil des planches des sieurs Marot, père et fils</i>. In addition
to decorative work these books contain prints of scenes in Dutch
history, and engravings of the statues and vases, produced by
Marot, at the Palace of Loo.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARPRELATE CONTROVERSY,<a name="ar192" id="ar192"></a></span> a war of pamphlets waged
in 1588 and 1589 between a puritan writer who employed
the pseudonym &ldquo;Martin Marprelate&rdquo; and defenders of the
Established Church. Martin&rsquo;s tracts are characterized by
violent and personal invective against the Anglican dignitaries,
by the assumption that the writer had numerous and powerful
adherents and was able to enforce his demands for reform, and
by a plain and homely style combined with pungent wit. While
he maintained the puritan doctrines as a whole, the special
point of his attack was the Episcopacy. The pamphlets were
printed at a secret press established by John Penry, a Welsh
puritan, with the help of the printer Robert Waldegrave, about
midsummer 1588, for the issue of puritan literature forbidden
by the authorities. The first tract by &ldquo;Martin Marprelate,&rdquo;
known as the <i>Epistle</i>, appeared at Molesey in November 1588.
It is in answer to <i>A Defence of the Government established in the
Church of Englande</i>, by Dr. John Bridges, dean of Salisbury,
itself a reply to earlier puritan works, and besides attacking
the episcopal office in general assails certain prelates with much
personal abuse. The <i>Epistle</i> attracted considerable notice, and
a reply was written by Thomas Cooper, bishop of Winchester,
under the title <i>An Admonition to the People of England</i>, but this
was too long and too dull to appeal to the same class of readers
as the Marprelate pamphlets, and produced little effect. Penry&rsquo;s
press, now removed to Fawsley, near Northampton, produced
a second tract by Martin, the <i>Epitome</i>, which contains more
serious argument than the <i>Epistle</i> but is otherwise similar,
and shortly afterwards, at Coventry, Martin&rsquo;s reply to the
<i>Admonition</i>, entitled <i>Hay any Worke for Cooper</i> (March 1589).
It now appeared to some of the ecclesiastical authorities that
the only way to silence Martin was to have him attacked in
his own railing style, and accordingly certain writers of ready
wit, among them John Lyly, Thomas Nashe and Robert
Greene, were secretly commissioned to answer the pamphlets.
Among the productions of this group were <i>Pappe with an
Hatchet</i> (Sept. 1589), probably by Lyly, and <i>An Almond for a
Parrat</i> (1590), which, with certain tracts under the pseudonym
of Pasquil, has been attributed to Nashe (<i>q.v.</i>). Some anti-Martinist
plays or shows (now lost) performed in 1589 were
perhaps also their work. Meanwhile, in July 1589, Penry&rsquo;s
press, now at Wolston, near Coventry, produced two tracts
purporting to be by &ldquo;sons&rdquo; of Martin, but probably by Martin
himself, namely, <i>Theses Martinianae</i> by Martin Junior, and <i>The
Just Censure of Martin Junior</i> by Martin Senior. Shortly after
this, <i>More Work for Cooper</i>, a sequel to <i>Hay any Worke</i>, was
begun at Manchester, but while it was in progress the press was
seized. Penry however was not found, and in September
issued from Wolston or Haseley <i>The Protestation of Martin
Marprelate</i>, the last work of the series, though several of the
anti-Martinist pamphlets appeared after this date. He then
fled to Scotland, but was later apprehended in London, charged
with inciting rebellion, and hanged (May 1593). The authorship
of the tracts has been attributed to several persons:
to Penry himself, who however emphatically denied it and
whose acknowledged works have little resemblance in style to
those of Martin, to Job Throckmorton, and to Henry Barrow.</p>

<p>See, for list and full titles of the tracts, related documents, and
discussion of the authorship, E. Arber&rsquo;s <i>Introductory Sketch to the

connected account of the matter. A good summary, with quotations
from the pamphlets, will be found in H. M. Dexter&rsquo;s <i>Congregationalism</i>

more important tracts have been reprinted by Petheram in his

the work on the death of the author in 1846. It took twenty
years to complete, and met with such success that a new edition
was soon called for. Finding himself unequal to the task
single-handed, Marquardt left the preparation of the first three
volumes (<i>Römisches Staatsrecht</i>) to Theodor Mommsen, while he
himself contributed vols. iv.-vi. (<i>Römische Staatsverwaltung</i>,

<p><span class="bold">MARQUESAS<a name="ar195" id="ar195"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Mendaña Islands</span> (Fr. <i>Les Marquises</i>),
an archipelago of the Pacific Ocean lying between 7° 50&prime; and
10° 35&prime; S. and 138° 50&prime; and 140° 50&prime; W., and belonging to France. It
extends over 250 m. from S.E. to N.W., and has a total area of
490 sq. m. The southern or Mendaña group consists of the islands
Fatuhiva or Magdalena, Motane or San Pedro, Tahuata or Santa
Christina and Hivaoa or Dominica, the last with a coast-line of
more than 60 m. With these is often included the rocky islet of
Fatuhuku or Hood, lying in mid-channel to the north of Hivaoa.
The north-western or Washington group is formed of seven
islands, the four largest being Huapu or Adams, Huahuna or
Washington, Nukuhiva (70 m. in circumference) and Eiao.<a name="fa1p" id="fa1p" href="#ft1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page751" id="page751"></a>751</span>
the centre of each island is a ridge of mountains, attaining an
altitude of 4042 ft in Huapu, whence rugged spurs forming deep
valleys stretch towards the sea. The volcanic origin of the whole
archipelago is proved by the principal rocks being of basalt,
trachyte and lava. Vegetation is luxuriant in the valleys,
which are well watered with streams and, from their seaward
termination in small bays, are themselves known as &ldquo;bays.&rdquo; The
flora includes about four hundred known species, many of them
identical with those belonging to the Society Islands. The
vegetable products comprise bananas, breadfruit, yams, plantains,
wild cotton, bamboos, sugarcane, coconut and dwarf
palms, and several kinds of timber trees. The land fauna however
is very poor; there are few mammals with the exception of
dogs, rats and pigs; and amphibia and insects are also generally
scarce. Of twenty species of birds more than half belong to the
sea, where animal life is as abundant as about other sub-tropical
Polynesian groups. The climate, although hot and damp, is
not unhealthy. During the greater part of the year moderate
easterly trade-winds prevail, and at the larger islands there are
often both land and sea breezes. The rainy season accompanied
by variable winds sets in at the end of November, and lasts for
about six months. During this period the thermometer varies
from 84° to 91° F.; in the dry season its average range is from 77°
to 86°. The archipelago, which has some small trade in copra,
cotton and cotton seeds, is administered by a French resident,
and has a total population of about 4300, nearly all natives.</p>

<p>The natives, a pure Polynesian race, are usually described as
physically the finest of all South Sea Islanders. Their traditions
point to Samoa as the colonizing centre from which they sprang.
Their complexion is a healthy bronze. Until the introduction
of civilization they were remarkable for their elaborate tattooing.
Their cannibalism seems to have been dictated by taste, for it
was never associated with their religion, the sacrifices to their
gods being always swine. Of these and fowls they rear a great
quantity. Their native drink is <i>kava</i>. Their houses are unlike
those usual in Polynesia in being built on platforms raised from
the ground. In disposition the islanders are friendly and hospitable,
brave and somewhat bloodthirsty; and, although naturally
indolent and morose, they have proved industrious and keen
traders. As among their kinsfolk the Tahitians, debauchery was
systematized and infanticide an organized institution. A population
which at the time of the annexation by France (1842)
was 20,000 has been reduced to little over 4000. Latterly the
natives have for the most part outwardly adopted Christianity.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Marquesas Islands were discovered on the 21st of July
1595 by Alvaro Mendaña, who, however, only knew of the south-eastern
group, to which he gave the name by which they are generally
known (although they also bear his own), in honour of Don
Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, marquis of Cañete, viceroy of Peru,
and patron of the voyage. Captain Cook pursuing the same track
rediscovered this group, with the addition of Fatuhuku, in 1774.
The north-western islands were first sighted by the American
Captain Ingraham in 1791, and given the name of Washington by
him; the French Captain Marchand followed in the same year,
and Lieut. Hergest in 1792. The Russian explorer, Adam
Ivan Krusenstern, made an extensive investigation of the archipelago
in 1804. In 1813 the American Commodore David Porter
failed to establish a colony here; and in May 1842, after French
Roman Catholic missionaries had prepared the way, Rear-admiral
Dupetit-Thouars took formal possession of the archipelago for
France. A complete settlement was not effected without bloodshed
and about 1860-1870 the colony was practically abandoned.</p>

med. Lat. <i>marchio</i>, <i>marchisus</i>, <i>i.e.</i> <i>comes marchiae</i>, &ldquo;count of the
March&rdquo;), a title and rank of nobility. In the British peerage
it is the second in order and therefore next to duke. In this
sense the word was a reintroduction from abroad; but lords of
the Welsh and Scottish &ldquo;marches&rdquo; are occasionally termed
<i>marchiones</i> from an early date. The first marquess in England
was Robert de Vere, the 9th earl of Oxford, who was created
marquess of Dublin by Richard II. on the 1st of December 1385
and assigned precedence between dukes and earls. On the 13th
of October following the patent of this marquessate was recalled,
Robert de Vere then having been raised to a dukedom. John
de Beaufort, earl of Somerset, the second legitimate son of John
of Gaunt, was raised to the second marquessate as marquess of
Dorset on the 29th of September 1397, but degraded again to
earl in 1399. The Commons petitioned for the restoration of
his marquessate in 1402, but he himself objected because &ldquo;le
noun de Marquys feust estraunge noun en cest Roialme.&rdquo; From
that period this title appears to have been dormant till the reign
of Henry VI., when it was revived (1442), and thenceforward it
maintained its place in the British peerage. Anne Boleyn was
created marchioness of Pembroke in 1532. A marquess is
&ldquo;most honourable,&rdquo; and is styled &ldquo;my lord marquess.&rdquo; His
wife, who is also &ldquo;most honourable,&rdquo; is a marchioness, and is
styled &ldquo;my lady marchioness.&rdquo; The coronet is a circlet of gold
on which rest four leaves and as many large pearls, all of them
of equal height and connected. The cap and lining, if worn, are
the same as in the other coronets (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crown</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coronet</a></span>).
The mantle of parliament is scarlet, and has three and a half
doublings of ermine.</p>

<p>In France, so early as the 9th century, counts who held several
counties and had succeeded in making themselves quasi-independent
began to describe themselves as <i>marchiones</i>, this use of the
word being due to the fact that originally none but the margraves,
or counts of the marches, had been allowed to hold more than
one county. The <i>marchio</i> or marquess thus came to be no more
than a count of exceptional power and dignity, the original significance
of the title being lost. In course of time the title was
recognized as ranking between those of duke and count; but
with the decay of feudalism it lost much of its dignity, and by the
17th century the savour of pretentiousness attached to it had
made it a favourite subject of satire for Molière and other dramatists
of the classical comedy. Abolished at the Revolution, the
title of marquess was not restored by Napoleon, but it was
again revived by Louis XVIII., who created many of Napoleon&rsquo;s
counts marquesses. This again tended to cheapen the title,
a process hastened under the republic by its frequent assumption
on very slender grounds in the absence of any authority to
prevent its abuse. In Italy too the title of <i>marchese</i>, once borne
only by the powerful margraves of Verona, has shared the fate
of most other titles of nobility in becoming common and of no
great social significance. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Margrave</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARQUETRY<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> (Fr. <i>marqueterie</i>, from <i>marqueter</i>, to inlay,
literally to mark, <i>marquer</i>), an inlay of ornamental woods,
ivory, bone, brass and other metals, tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl,
&amp;c., in which shaped pieces of different materials or tints
are combined to form a design. It is a later development of the
ornamental inlays of wood known by the name of Intarsia, and
though in the main the latter was a true inlay of one or more
colours upon a darker or lighter ground, while marquetry is
composed of pieces of quite thin wood or other material of equal
thickness laid down upon a matrix with glue, there are examples
of Intarsia in which this mode of manufacture was evidently
followed. For instance, the backs of the stalls in the cathedral
of Ferrara show the perspective lines of some of the subjects
traced upon the ground where the marquetry has fallen off, but
none of the sinkings in the surface which would be there if the
panels had been executed as true inlays. In the endeavour to gain
greater relief, shading and tinting the wood were resorted to, the
shading being generally produced by scorching, either with a hot
iron or hot sand, and the tinting by chemical washes and even by
the use of actual colour, but the result is usually hardly commensurate
with the labour expended. A combination of tortoise-shell
and metal, the one forming the ground and the other the
pattern upon it, which may be classed as marquetry also appears
in the 17th century. The subjects of the <i>intarsiatori</i> are generally
arabesques or panels with elaborate perspectives, either of
buildings or cupboards with different articles upon the shelves
seen through half-open doors, which themselves are frequently
of lattice-work delineated with extraordinary perfection, though
figure subjects occur also. The later <i>marqueteurs</i> used a freer
form of design for the most part, and scrolls and bunches of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page752" id="page752"></a>752</span>
flowers appear in profusion, while if architectural forms occur
they are generally in the shape of ruins amid landscape. The
greater portion of the examples in England are importations,
either from Holland (in which country very fine work was produced
during the latter half of the 16th and 17th centuries) or
from France. The reputation of the Dutch <i>marqueteurs</i> was so
great that Colbert engaged two, named Pierre Gole and Vordt,
for the Gobelins at the beginning of the 17th century. Jean
Macé of Blois, the first Frenchman known to have practised the
art, who was at work in Paris from 1644 (when he was lodged in
the Louvre), or earlier, till 1672, as a sculptor and painter, learnt
it in the Netherlands. His title was &ldquo;menuisier et faiseur de
cabinets et tableaux en marqueterie de bois&rdquo;; but as early as
1576 a certain Hans Kraus had been called &ldquo;marqueteur du
roi.&rdquo; Jean Macé&rsquo;s daughter married Pierre Boulle, and the
greatest of the family, André Charles Boulle (<i>q.v.</i>), succeeded to
his lodging in the Louvre on his death in 1672. The members of
this family are perhaps the best known of the French <i>marqueteurs</i>.
Their greatest triumphs were gained in the marquetry of metal
and tortoise-shell combined with beautifully chiselled ormulu
mountings; but many foreign workmen found employment in
France from the time of Colbert, and some of them rose to the
highest eminence. The names of Roentgen, under whom the
later German marquetry perhaps reached its highest point,
Riesener and Oeben, testify to their nationality. A good deal of
marquetry was executed in England in the later Stuart period,
mainly upon long-case clocks, cabinets and chests of drawers,
and it is often of real excellence. Marquetry in a shallower form
was also extensively used in the latter part of the 18th century.
The most beautiful examples of the art in Italy are mainly panels
of choir stalls or sacristy cupboards, though marriage coffers
were also often sumptuously decorated in this manner. With
the increase in luxury and display in the 17th and 18th centuries
in France and Germany cabinets and escritoires became objects
upon which extraordinary talent and expenditure were lavished.
In South Germany musical instruments, weapons and bride
chests were often lavishly decorated with marquetry. The
cabinets are of elaborate architectural design with inlays of
ebony and ivory or with veneers of black and white, the design
counterchanging so that one cutting produced several repeats
of the same pattern in one colour or the other. In modern
practice as many as four or even six thicknesses are put together
and so cut. When all the parts have been cut and fitted together
face downwards paper is glued over them to keep them
in place and the ground and the veneer are carefully levelled
and toothed so as to obtain a freshly worked surface. The
ground is then well wetted with glue at a high temperature and
the surfaces squeezed tightly together between frames called
&ldquo;cauls&rdquo; till the glue is hard. There are several modes of
ensuring the accurate fitting of the various parts, which is a
matter of the first importance.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARQUETTE, JACQUES<a name="ar198" id="ar198"></a></span> (1637-1675), French Jesuit missionary
and explorer, re-discoverer (with Louis Joliet) of the Mississippi.
He was born at Laon, went to Canada in 1666, and was
sent in 1668 to the upper lakes of the St Lawrence. Here he
worked at Sault Ste Marie, St Esprit (near the western extremity
of Lake Superior) and St Ignace (near Michilimackinac or
Mackinaw, on the strait between Huron and Michigan). In 1673
he was chosen with Joliet for the exploration of the Mississippi,
of which the French had begun to gain knowledge from Indians
of the central prairies. The route taken lay up the north-west
side of Lake Michigan, up Green Bay and Fox river, across
Lake Winnebago, over the portage to the Wisconsin river, and
down the latter into the Mississippi, which was descended to
within 700 m. of the sea, at the confluence of the Arkansas river.
Entering the Mississippi on the 17th of May, Joliet and his
companion turned back on the 17th of July, and returned to
Green Bay and Michigan (by way of the Illinois river) at the end
of September 1673. On the journey Marquette fell ill of dysentery;
and a fresh excursion which he undertook to plant a
mission among the Indians of the Illinois river in the winter of
1674-1675 proved fatal. He died on his way home to St Ignace on
the banks of a small stream (the lesser and older Marquette River)
which enters the east side of Lake Michigan in Marquette Bay
(May 18, 1675). His name is now borne by a larger watercourse
which flows some distance from the scene of his death.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARQUETTE,<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span> a city, a port of entry and the county seat of
Marquette county, Michigan U.S.A., on the south shore of Lake
Superior. Pop. (1900), 10,058 (3460 foreign-born); (1910), 11,503.
It is served by the Duluth, South Shore &amp; Atlantic, the Marquette
&amp; South-Eastern, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul, the Chicago
&amp; North-Western, and the Lake Superior &amp; Ishpeming railways.
The city, which is situated on a bluff 100 ft. above the lake, in
a region characterized by rounded hills and picturesque irregularities,
has a delightful climate, and is a popular summer resort.
Presque Isle park (400 acres), a headland north of the city, is
one of its principal attractions. Marquette is the seat of the
Northern State Normal School (established 1899) and of the
state house of correction and branch prison (established 1885).
A county-court-house, the Peter White library, and the Federal
building are the most prominent public buildings. Marquette is
the seat of Roman Catholic and Protestant Episcopal bishoprics.
The city is best known as a shipping centre of one of the richest
iron-ore districts in the world, and its large and well-equipped
ore docks are among its most prominent features. Marquette is
the port of entry of the customs district of Superior. In 1896 its
imports were valued at $358,505 and its exports at $4,708,302;
in 1908, imports $1,845,724 and exports $7,040,473. Foundries,
railway machine-shops, lumber and planing-mills, brewery and
bottling works, and quarries of brownish-red sandstone contribute
largely to the city&rsquo;s economic importance. The charcoal
iron blast-furnaces of the city manufacture pig-iron, and, as
by-products, wood alcohol and acetic acid, recovered from the
smoke of the charcoal pits. The value of the city&rsquo;s factory
products increased from $1,585,083 in 1900 to $2,364,081 in
1905, or 49.1%. The first settlement was made about 1845,
and in 1849 it was named Worcester; but &ldquo;Marquette&rdquo; was
soon substituted in honour of Jacques Marquette. It was
incorporated as a village in 1859, and chartered as a city in
1871.</p>

an engraver. He was a pupil of Henry Vianden in Milwaukee,
of Schauss in Weimar, of Gussow in Berlin, and subsequently of
Otto Seitz, Gabriel and Max Lindenschmitt in Munich. His
first work, &ldquo;Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew,&rdquo; received a medal

Royal Hanover Gallery, and his &ldquo;Germany in 1806&rdquo; received
a gold medal in Munich and is in the Royal Academy of Koenigsberg.

<p><span class="bold">MARR&#256;KESH<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> (erroneously <span class="sc">Morocco</span> or <span class="sc">Marocco City</span>), one of
the quasi-capitals of the sultanate of Morocco, Fez and Mequinez
being the other two. It lies in a spacious plain&mdash;Blad el Hamra,
&ldquo;The Red&rdquo;&mdash;about 15 m. from the northern underfalls of the
Atlas, and 96 m. E.S.E. of Saffi, at a height variously estimated
at 1639 ft. (Hooker and Ball) and 1410 ft. (Beaumier). Ranking
during the early centuries of its existence as one of the greatest
cities of Isl&#257;m, Marr&#257;kesh has long been in a state of grievous
decay, but it is rendered attractive by the exceptional beauty of
its situation, the luxuriant groves and gardens by which it is
encompassed and interspersed, and the magnificent outlook
which it enjoys towards the mountains. The wall, 25 or 30 ft.
high, and relieved at intervals of 360 ft. by square towers, is so
dilapidated that foot-passengers, and in places even horsemen,
can find their way through the breaches. Open spaces of great
extent are numerous within the walls, but for the most part they
are defaced by mounds of rubbish and putrid refuse. With the
exception of the tower of the Kutubia Mosque and a certain
archway which was brought in pieces from Spain, there is not, it
is asserted, a single stone building in the city; and even bricks
(although the local manufacture is of excellent quality) are
sparingly employed. <i>Tabiya</i> or rammed concrete of red earth
and stone is the almost universal building material, and the
houses are consequently seldom more than two storeys in height.
The palace of the sultan covers an extensive area, and beyond
it lie the imperial parks of Agudal, the inner one reserved for
the sultan&rsquo;s exclusive use. The tower of the Kutubia is a
memorial of the constructive genius of the early Moors; both it
and the similar Hasan tower at Rabat are after the type of the
contemporary Giralda at Seville, and if tradition may be trusted,
all three were designed by the same architect, Jabir. The mosque
to which the tower belongs is a large brick building erected by
&lsquo;Abd el Mumin; the interior is adorned with marble pillars, and
the whole of the crypt is occupied by a vast cistern excavated
by Yak&#363;b el Mansur. Other mosques of some note are those of
Ibn Yusef, El Mansur and El Mo&rsquo;izz; the chapel of Sidi Bel
Abbas, in the extreme north of the city, possesses property of
great value, and serves as an almshouse and asylum. There is
a special Jews&rsquo; quarter walled off from the rest. The general
population is of a very mixed and turbulent kind; crimes of
violence are common, and there are many professional thieves.
The murder of a Frenchman, Dr Mauchamp, in March 1907, by
the rabble of Marr&#257;kesh was the immediate cause of the occupation
of Udja by France (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Morocco</a></span>: <i>History</i>). Almost the
only manufacture extensively prosecuted is that of Morocco
leather, mainly red and yellow, about 1,500 men being employed
as tanners and shoemakers. Scottish missionaries and a few
European traders have become established here. The city was
founded in 1062 by Yusef bin Tashfin. Before it was a hundred
years old it is said to have had 700,000 inhabitants, but the
population in 1906 probably did not exceed 50,000 to 60,000.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARRI,<a name="ar204" id="ar204"></a></span> a Baluch tribe on the Dera Ghazi Khan border of
Baluchistan. In the census of 1901 they numbered 19,161 and
their fighting strength is about 3000. Their relations with the
British commenced in 1840 with attacks made on the communications
of Sir John Keane&rsquo;s army, after it had passed through the
Bolan. An attempt was made to punish the tribe, which ended
in disastrous failure. Major Clibborn was repulsed in an attempt
to storm the Naffusak Pass, losing 179 killed and 92 wounded
out of 650. Many of his force died of heat and thirst. The fort
of Kahan, which he was trying to relieve at the time, was forced
to capitulate with the honours of war. The Marris, however,
joined the British against the Bugtis in 1845. After the annexation
of Sind in 1843 the Marris gave much trouble, but were
pacified by the policy of General John Jacob and Sir Robert
Sandeman. In 1880 during the second Afghan War they made
frequent raids on the British line of communications, ending with
the plunder of a treasure convoy. A force of 3070 British
troops under Brigadier-General Macgregor marched through
the country, and the tribe submitted and paid 1<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span> lakh (£12,500)
out of a fine of 2 lakhs (£20,000); they also gave hostages for their
future good behaviour. Since then they have given little trouble.</p>

<p>The Marri-Bugti country is classed as a tribal area in Baluchistan,
politically controlled from Sibi, but enjoying a large measure
of autonomy under its own chieftains. Total area, 7129 sq. m.;
total pop. (1901), 38,919, almost equally divided between the two
tribes of Marris and Bugtis.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARRIAGE.<a name="ar205" id="ar205"></a></span> Marriage (Fr. <i>mariage</i>, from <i>marier</i>, to marry;
Lat. <i>maritare</i>, from <i>mas</i>, <i>maris</i>, a male), or &ldquo;matrimony&rdquo;
(Lat. <i>matrimonium</i>, from <i>mater</i>, a mother), may be defined
either (<i>a</i>) as the act, ceremony, or process by which the legal
relationship of husband and wife is constituted; or (<i>b</i>) as a
physical, legal and moral union between man and woman in
complete community of life for the establishment of a family.<a name="fa1q" id="fa1q" href="#ft1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
It is possible to discriminate between three stages, taking marriage
in the latter sense as an institution&mdash;the animal or physical
stage, the proprietary or legal stage, and the personal or moral
stage. In the first or physical stage the relation of the sexes was
unregulated, and in many cases of brief duration. In the second
or legal stage greater permanence was secured in marriage by
assigning the husband a property right in his wife or wives. In
the last stage the proprietary relation falls more and more into
the background, and the relation of husband and wife approximates
that of two individuals entirely equal before the law.
Although in the history of marriage these three stages have been
roughly successive, the order of their entering the conscious
experience of the individual is usually the reverse of their order
in the development of the race; and in the solemnization of a
marriage based upon affection and choice the growth of the
relation begins with the moral, advances to the legal and culminates
in the physical union, each one of these deriving its
meaning and its worth from the preceding. In most legal
systems marriage, in the sense of a ceremony, takes the form of a
contract&mdash;the mutual assent of the parties being the prominent
and indispensable feature. Whether it is really a contract or
not, and if so to what class of contracts it belongs, are questions
which have been much discussed, but into which it is
not necessary to enter. While the consent of parties is universally
deemed one of the conditions of a legal marriage, all
the incidents of the relationship constituted by the act are absolutely
fixed by law. The jurist has to deal with marriage in so
far as it creates the legal status of husband and wife. It should
be added that, while marriage is generally spoken of by lawyers
as a contract, its complete isolation from all other contracts is
invariably recognized. Its peculiar position may be seen at
once by comparing it with other contracts giving rise to continuous
relationships with more or less indefinite obligations, like
those of landlord and tenant, master and servant, &amp;c. In these
the parties may in general make their rights and duties what they
please, the law only intervening when they are silent. In
marriage every resulting right and duty is fixed by the law.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Besides true marriage, inferior forms of union have from time
to time been recognized, and may be briefly noticed here. These
have all but disappeared from modern society, depending as they
do on matrimonial restrictions now obsolete.</p>

<p>The institution of slavery is a fruitful source of this kind of debased
matrimony. In Roman law no slave could contract marriage
whether with another slave or a free person. The union of male
and female slaves (<i>contubernium</i>) was recognized for various purposes;
a free woman entering into a union with a slave incurred under the
S.C. Claudianum the forfeiture of her own liberty; but the bondwoman
might be the concubine of a freeman. In the United States,
where slavery was said to be regulated by the principle of the
civil law, the marriage of slaves was so far recognized that on
emancipation complete matrimony took effect and the children
became legitimate without any new ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page754" id="page754"></a>754</span></p>

<p>In Roman law no legal marriage could be contracted unless there
was <i>connubium</i> between the parties. Originally there was no
connubium between plebs and patricians, and the privilege was
conceded after a long struggle by the Lex Canuleia. In later times
Latini and Peregrini were excluded from connubium except where
the right had been expressly conferred. The great matrimonial
law of the early empire (Lex Julia et Papia Poppaea) introduced
restrictions depending on the condition of the parties which later
legislation extended and perpetuated. Senators under that law
were forbidden to marry freedwomen or women of inferior rank,
and the husband of a freedwoman becoming a senator was set
free from his marriage. In the canon law<a name="fa2q" id="fa2q" href="#ft2q"><span class="sp">2</span></a> new restrictions were
developed. Persons who bound themselves not to marry were
deemed incapable of marrying. The order of the clergy were
forbidden to marry. And disparity of faith was recognized by the
early church as a bar to matrimony, <i>e.g.</i> between Christians and
pagans and between orthodox and heretics (see <i>Dictionary of
Christian Antiquities</i>, art. &ldquo;Marriage&rdquo;).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Concubinage</span>, which such restrictions tended to develop, is
noticed under a separate heading (<i>q.v.</i>). It might be described as
marriage which has no consequences, or only slight and peculiar
consequences, in legal <i>status</i>. In the left-handed or &ldquo;morganatic&rdquo;
marriages of the German royal families we have the nearest approach
ever made by concubinage to true marriage, the children being
legitimate, but neither they nor the wife acquiring any right to the
rank or fortune of the husband. The marriage of persons of different
religions frequently requires the intervention of the law as to the
faith of the children, more particularly in Europe as between
Roman Catholics and Protestants. English law gives the father,
except under special circumstances, the right to dictate the faith
of his children (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Infant</a></span>). The practice on this point varies in
Europe&mdash;the question being ignored in French law, Germany
following in some parts the same rule as England, in others giving
effect to ante-nuptial stipulations. In Ireland mixed marriages
(<i>i.e.</i> between Roman Catholic and Protestant) were by 19 Geo. II.
c. 13 null and void if celebrated by a Roman Catholic priest. This
act was repealed by 33 &amp; 34 Vict. <i>c.</i> 110, which permits mixed
marriages to be validly celebrated by an Episcopalian or Roman
Catholic clergyman, subject to conditions set forth in § 38.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Roman law.</i>&mdash;The three primitive modes of marriage were
<i>confarreatio</i>, <i>coemptio in manum</i>, and <i>usus</i>, all of which had the
effect of placing the woman in the &ldquo;power&rdquo; (<i>manus</i>) of her
husband, and on the same footing as the children. The first
was a religious ceremony before ten witnesses, in which an ox
was sacrificed and a wheaten cake broken and divided between
the spouses by the priest. <i>Coemptio</i> was a conveyance of the
woman by <i>mancipatio</i>, and might be described as a fictitious sale
<i>per aes et libram</i>, like that employed in emancipation and testamentary
disposition and other processes. <i>Usus</i> was the acquisition
of the wife by prescription, through her cohabiting with
the husband for one year, without having been absent from his
house three continuous nights. But a true marriage might be
concluded without adopting any of these modes, and they all
fell into desuetude and with them the subjection of the wife to
the <i>manus</i>. Marriage without <i>manus</i> was contracted by the
interchange of consent, without writing or formality of any
kind. By some jurists it is regarded as incomplete until consummated
by delivery of the woman, and is accordingly referred
to the class of <i>real</i> contracts. The restrictions as to age, relationship
by consanguinity and affinity, previous marriage, &amp;c.,
were in the main those which have continued to prevail in modern
Europe with one important exception. The consent of the
<i>paterfamilias</i> to the marriage of the children under his power was
essential.</p>

<p><i>Canon law.</i>&mdash;The canon law of marriage is based partly on
the Roman law, the validity of which the Church from the first
recognized, partly on the Jewish law as modified by the new
principles introduced by Christ and his apostles, developed
by the fathers of the Church and medieval schoolmen, and regulated
and defined by popes and councils. The most important
of these principles was that of the indissolubility of marriage,
proclaimed by Christ without qualification according to Mark x.
11, 12, and with the qualifying clause &ldquo;saving for the cause
of fornication&rdquo; according to Matt. v. 32. This lofty view of
marriage, according to which man and wife are made &ldquo;one
flesh&rdquo; by the act of God (&ldquo;What therefore God hath joined
together, let no man put asunder,&rdquo; Mark x. 9) was, however,
modified by the idea of the consummating act of marriage as in
itself something unholy, a result of the Fall. Christ himself,
indeed, did not teach this; but for St Paul marriage is clearly a
concession to the weakness of the flesh (1 Cor. vii.). &ldquo;The time
is short,&rdquo; and in view of the imminent coming of the Lord the
procreation of children a matter of no importance (v. 29), but
&ldquo;it is better to marry than to burn&rdquo; (v. 9). He is, however,
obviously not clear on the point, and at the end of his argument
strikes a note of doubt (v. 40); elsewhere he defends marriage,
against those who would have forbidden it altogether, as a
gift of God (1 Tit. iv. 3-5) and even, in seeming contradiction
to 1 Cor. vii. 29, commands the bearing of children (1 Tit. v. 14).
Finally it is to St Paul that the idea of marriage as a sacrament
is to be traced, in the mystic comparison of the relations of
husband and wife to those of Christ and his Church (Eph. v.
23-32). These are the main foundations in Scripture on which
the Christian law of marriage is built up, and they are obviously
principles which admit of a large amount of variety of interpretation
and of practice. They were developed in the early
Church under the influence of the rapidly growing passion for
the celibate life, partly an outcome of the same dualistic principle
which produced the asceticism of the Jewish Essenes and of the
Gnostics, partly perhaps a natural reaction from the appalling
moral corruption of the decaying empire. Marriage, it is true,
from being no more than a terminable civil contract, became a
thing holy, a mystic union of souls and bodies never to be
divided; valid, indeed, but not spiritually complete, without the
public blessing of the Church (Tertullian, <i>Ad uxorem</i>, lib. ii.
cap. 9); and from Augustine&rsquo;s time onward it was reckoned as a
sacrament. But at the same time there was a tendency to restrict
its rights and its range. So far as marriage was a physical
union, this had for its object solely the perpetuation of the race
and the avoidance of fornication; the most that was conceded
was that the intention of having offspring not only made the
conjugal act blameless, but even gave to the desire that inspired
it an element of good (Augustine, <i>de nupt. et conc.</i> 3). But the
ideal married life was that attributed to Mary and Joseph.
Thus Augustine cited this as an example that a true marriage
may exist where there is a mutual vow of chastity (<i>op. cit.</i> 12),
and held that the sooner this relation was established the better
(<i>de bono conjug.</i> 22). Marriage being then an inferior state, to
be discouraged rather than the reverse, the tendency was
rapidly to narrow the field within which it might be contracted.
Remarriage (bigamy) was only allowed after many struggles,
and then only to the laity; St Paul had laid down that a
&ldquo;bishop&rdquo; must be &ldquo;the husband of one wife,&rdquo; and to this day
the priests of the Orthodox Eastern Church may not remarry.
Clerical celibacy, at first a counsel of perfection, was soon to
become the rule of the Church, though it was long before it was
universally enforced in the West; in the East it still applies
only to monks, nuns and bishops (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Celibacy</a></span>). The marriage
of the laity was hampered by the creation of a number of impediments.
The few and definite prohibitions of the Roman and of
the Jewish law (Lev. xviii. 6-18; xx.) in the matter of marriage
between kindred, were indefinitely extended; until in 506 the
council of Agde laid it down that any consanguinity or affinity
whatever constituted an impediment.<a name="fa3q" id="fa3q" href="#ft3q"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Moreover, man and wife
being &ldquo;one flesh,&rdquo; the Church exaggerated relationship by
affinity into equal importance with that of consanguinity as an
impediment to matrimony; and, finally, to all this added the
impediments created by &ldquo;<span class="correction" title="amended from spirtual">spiritual</span> affinity,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the relations
established between baptizer and baptized, confirmer and confirmed,
and between godparents, their godchildren and their
godchildren&rsquo;s relatives.</p>

<p>The result of this system was hopeless confusion and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page755" id="page755"></a>755</span>
uncertainty, and it was early found necessary to modify it. This
was done by Pope Gregory I., who limited the impediment to
the 7th degree of relationship inclusive (civil computation)<a name="fa4q" id="fa4q" href="#ft4q"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
which was afterwards made the law of the empire by Charlemagne.
Later still Innocent III. found it necessary again to
issue a decree (4th Lateran Council) permitting marriages between
a husband and the relations of his wife, and vice versa,
beyond the 4th degree inclusive (canonical computation).<a name="fa5q" id="fa5q" href="#ft5q"><span class="sp">5</span></a> This
remains the canonical rule of the Roman Catholic Church. As
regards impediments due to spiritual affinity, these were limited
by the Council of Trent to the relation of the baptizer and
baptized; the baptizer and the parents of the baptized; the baptizer
and the godfather and godmother; the godparents and the
baptized and its parents: <i>i.e.</i> a godfather may not marry the
mother of the child he has held at the font, nor the godmother
the father of such child.</p>

<p>In the fully developed canon law impediments to marriage
are of two kinds, public and private (<i>impedimenta publica</i> and
<i>privata</i>), <i>i.e.</i> according as the objection arises out of the very
nature of marriage itself or from consideration for the rights of
particular persons; near relationship, for instance, is a public
impediment, impotence (<i>impotentia</i>) and force (<i>vis et metus</i>) are
private impediments. Impediments are further divided into
separating (<i>impedimenta dirimentia</i>) or merely suspensive
(<i>impedimenta tantum impedientia</i>); to the first class belongs,
<i>e.g.</i> a previous marriage not dissolved by death, which involves
the nullification of the marriage even where through ignorance
the crime of bigamy is not involved; to the second belongs the
case of one or both of the contracting parties being under
the age of puberty.<a name="fa6q" id="fa6q" href="#ft6q"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Impediments, moreover, are absolute or
relative, according as they are of universal application or only
affect certain persons; near relationship, for instance, is an
absolute impediment, difference of religion between the parties
a relative impediment. In addition to consanguinity and
affinity, impuberty and existing marriage, the canon law lays
down as public and absolute impediments to marriage the taking
of holy orders and the vows of chastity made on entering
any of the religious orders approved by the Holy See. In these
impediments the canon law further distinguishes between those
which are based on the law of nature (<i>jus naturae</i>) and those
which are based on the law of the Church (<i>jus ecclesiae</i>). From
impediments based on the law of nature, or of God, there is no
power even in the pope to dispense; <i>e.g.</i> marriage of father and
daughter, brother and sister, or remarriage of husband or wife
during the lifetime of the wife or husband of another marriage,
which is held to be a violation of the very nature of marriage as
an indissoluble union.<a name="fa7q" id="fa7q" href="#ft7q"><span class="sp">7</span></a> From impediments arising out of the
law of the Church dispensations are granted, more or less readily,
either by the pope or by the bishop of the diocese in virtue of
powers delegated by the pope (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dispensation</a></span>). Thus dispensations
may be granted for marriage between persons related
by consanguinity in any beyond the 2nd degree and not in the
direct line of ascent or descent; <i>e.g.</i> between uncle and niece
(confined by the council of Trent to the case of royal marriages
for reasons of state) and between cousins-german, or in the case
of marriage with a heretic. In this latter case a dispensation
is now (<i>i.e.</i> since the papal decrees <i>ne temere</i> of the 2nd of August
1907, which came into force at Easter 1908) only granted on condition
that the parties are married by a Catholic bishop, or a
priest accredited by him, that no religious ceremony shall take
place except in a Catholic church, and that all the children
shall be brought up in the Roman Catholic faith.<a name="fa8q" id="fa8q" href="#ft8q"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p>In the absence of any impediment a marriage is according
to the canon law completed between baptized persons by the
facts of consent and consummation; the principle is still maintained
that the parties to the marriage, not the priest, are the
&ldquo;ministers of the sacrament&rdquo; (<i>ministri sacramenti</i>).<a name="fa9q" id="fa9q" href="#ft9q"><span class="sp">9</span></a> From
the first, however, the Church, while recognizing the validity of
private contracts, enjoined the addition of a public religious
ceremony, so that they might be &ldquo;sanctified by the word of God
and prayer&rdquo; (1 Tim. iv. 5).<a name="fa10q" id="fa10q" href="#ft10q"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Tertullian (<i>de pudicitia</i>, cap. iv.)
says that clandestine marriages, not professed in the Church,
were reckoned among Christians as all but fornication, and he
speaks of the custom of seeking permission to marry from the
bishop, priests and deacons (<i>de monogamia</i>, cap. xi.). This latter
precaution became increasingly necessary as impediments were
multiplied, and Charlemagne, in a capitulary of 802, forbade the
celebration of a marriage until &ldquo;the bishops, priests and elders
of the people&rdquo; had made diligent inquiry into the question of
the consanguinity of the parties. This was the origin of the
publication of banns which, long customary in France, was made
obligatory on the whole Church by Pope Innocent III. In the
Eastern Church the primitive practice survives in the ceremonial
blessing by the priest of the betrothal, as distinguished from the
marriage ceremony. The ecclesiastical recognition of clandestine
marriages, however, survived until the crying evil was remedied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page756" id="page756"></a>756</span>
by a decree of the council of Trent (Sess. xiv. <i>de matrim.</i>),<a name="fa11q" id="fa11q" href="#ft11q"><span class="sp">11</span></a> which
laid it down that for a valid marriage it was at least necessary
that consent should be declared before a priest and in the presence
of three witnesses. According to the actual law of the
Roman Catholic Church, then, a civil marriage is only valid
when the Tridentine decree has not been published; where this
has been published, or has been in practice without publication,
such a marriage can only become valid if followed by a religious
ceremony in the prescribed form. Where such form has not
followed the ecclesiastical courts must treat the marriage as
voidable through the <i>impedimentum clandestinitatis</i>.</p>

<p>Divorce, <i>i.e.</i> the annulment of marriage for any cause but an
impediment which makes the marriage <i>ipso facto</i> void, is unknown
to the Roman Catholic Church. Separation <i>a vinculo
matrimonii</i> is only possible under the canon law by a judicial
decree of nullity (<i>annullatio matrimonii</i>), which implies, not the
severing of the ties of a real marriage, but the solemn declaration
that such marriage has never existed. There may, however,
be a &ldquo;separation from bed and board&rdquo; (<i>a thoro et mensa</i>), even
perpetual, which does not however give either party the right
to remarry during the lifetime of the other. But, marriage
not being regarded as a sacrament until consummated, it may
be dissolved, if non-consummation he proved, by one or both
parties taking the religious vows, or by papal dispensation.
The Church claims exclusive control over marriage, and the
council of Trent anathematized the opinion held by Luther
and other Reformers, that it was properly a subject for the
civil courts (<i>si quis dixerit causas matrimoniales non spectare ad
judices ecclesiasticos anathema sit</i>, Sess. xxiv. cap. 2). This
attitude became of extreme political importance when even in
Catholic countries the codes established civil marriage as the
only legally binding form.</p>

<p><i>England.</i>&mdash;Marriage may be the subject of an ordinary contract
on which an action may be brought by either party. It is not
necessary that the promise should be in writing, or that any
particular time should be named. Promises to marry are not
within the meaning of &ldquo;agreement made in consideration of
marriage&rdquo; in the statute of frauds, which requires such agreements
to be in writing. Contracts in restraint of marriage,
<i>i.e.</i> whose object is to prevent a person from marrying anybody
whatever, are void, as are also contracts undertaking for reward
to procure a marriage between two persons. These latter are
termed marriage brocage contracts.</p>

<p>Any man and woman are capable of marrying, subject to
certain disabilities, some of which are said to be canonical as
having been formerly under the cognisance of the ecclesiastical
courts, others civil. The effect of a canonical disability as such
was to make the marriage not void but voidable. The marriage
must be set aside by regular process, and sentence pronounced
during the lifetime of the parties. Natural inability at the
time of the marriage to procreate children is a canonical disability.
So was relationship within the prohibited degrees,
which has been made an absolute avoidance of marriage by
the Marriage Act 1835. Civil disabilities are (1) the fact that
either party is already married and has a spouse still living;<a name="fa12q" id="fa12q" href="#ft12q"><span class="sp">12</span></a>
(2) the fact that either person is a party of unsound mind;
(3) want of full age, which for this purpose is fixed at the age
of puberty as defined in the Roman law, viz. fourteen for males
and twelve for females;<a name="fa13q" id="fa13q" href="#ft13q"><span class="sp">13</span></a> (4) relationship within the prohibited
degrees.</p>

<p>The statute which lawyers regard as establishing the rule on
this last point is the 32 Hen. VIII. c. 38 (repealed in part
by 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 23, in whole by 1 &amp; 2 P. and M. c. 8, but
revived by 1 Eliz. c. 1, and so left as under the Act of Edward),
which enacts that &ldquo;no prohibition, God&rsquo;s law except, shall
trouble or impeach any marriage without the Levitical degrees.&rdquo;
The forbidden marriages, as more particularly specified in
previous statutes, are those between persons in the ascending
and descending line <i>in infinitum</i>, and those between collaterals
to the third degree inclusive, according to the computation of
the civil law. The prohibitions extend not only to <i>consanguinei</i>
(related by blood) but to <i>affines</i> (related by marriage), now altered
so far as a deceased wife&rsquo;s sister is concerned (see below). The
act of 1835 enacted that &ldquo;all marriages which shall hereafter
be celebrated between persons within the prohibited degrees
of consanguinity or affinity shall be absolutely null and void
to all intents and purposes whatsoever.&rdquo; They had previously
been only voidable. The act at the same time legalized
marriages within the prohibited degrees of affinity (but not consanguinity)
actually celebrated before the 31st of August 1835.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For many years an active and ceaseless agitation was carried on
on behalf of the legalization in England of marriage with a deceased
wife&rsquo;s sister. In all the self-governing colonies, with the
exception of Newfoundland, the restriction had ceased to
<span class="sidenote">Marriage with a Deceased Wife&rsquo;s Sister.</span>
exist. The first act legalizing marriage with a deceased
wife&rsquo;s sister was adopted by South Australia. The
royal assent, however, was not given till the parliament
of that state had five times passed the bill. In quick
succession similar statutes followed in Victoria, Tasmania, New South
Wales, Queensland, New Zealand, West Australia, Barbados, Canada,
Mauritius, Natal and Cape Colony. As regards the Channel
Islands, marriages of the kind in question were made legal in 1899,
and in 1907 in the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>In England the bill to render marriage with a deceased wife&rsquo;s
sister valid was first adopted by the House of Commons in 1850,
and rejected by the House of Lords in 1851. It was subsequently
brought before the legislature in 1855, 1856, 1858, 1859, 1861, 1862,
1866, 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872, 1873, 1875, 1877 and 1878 (Colonial
bills), 1879 (6th May, when in the House of Lords the prince of
Wales and the duke of Edinburgh voted in favour of it), 1880, 1882,
1883, 1884, 1886, 1888, 1889, 1890, 1891, 1896, and 1898 and 1900
(Colonial bills). In most cases it passed the House of Commons
but was rejected in the House of Lords. The bill of 1896, however,
which was judiciously drafted to avoid the compulsory celebration
by clergymen of marriages against which they had conscientious
scruples, was carried in the Lords. Both the prince of Wales and the
duke of York were among the &ldquo;contents.&rdquo; The prime minister and
eighteen bishops, including the two archbishops, voted against the
bill, the earl of Rosebery and Lord Kimberley for it. At the third
reading the bill was carried by 142 to 104 votes. Its promoters,
however, did not succeed in getting an opportunity of bringing it
before the House of Commons.</p>

<p>From 1896 to 1901 no further direct steps were taken, but in 1898
and again in 1900 (May 28) the subject was brought forward in the
House of Lords by Lord Strathcona in the form of a bill under which
marriages with a deceased wife&rsquo;s sister contracted in any British
colony should be deemed valid for all purposes within the United
Kingdom. In 1898, and again in 1900, the bill was carried on the
third reading without a dissentient vote. The House of Commons
took no action on either occasion. An imperial bill reached a second
reading in the House of Commons in 1901 and again in 1902, but it
was blocked by the High Church opponents of the measure when
attempts were made to get it to the committee stage (Feb. 5 and June
6). The reform was, however, finally adopted in 1906 under the
title of the Colonial Marriages (Deceased Wife&rsquo;s Sister) Act. The
effect of the act was to make such marriages legal in all respects,
including the right of succession to real property and to honours
and dignities within the United Kingdom. The natural sequence
of the passing of the act of 1906 was the reintroduction in 1907 of
the bill relating to England. Introduced by a private member, it
was adopted by the government, passed the House of Commons, and
finally the House of Lords (on the second reading by 111 votes to
79), and became law as the Deceased Wife&rsquo;s Sister Marriage Act, 1907.
The act contains a proviso justifying clergymen in refusing to
solemnize marriages with a deceased wife&rsquo;s sister, and it preserves
the peculiar status of the wife&rsquo;s sister under the Matrimonial Causes
Act 1857, under which adultery with her by the husband is incestuous
adultery.</p>

<p>The celebration of marriages is now regulated wholly by statutory
legislation. The most important acts in force are the Marriage
Acts 1823, 1836, 1886 and 1898.<a name="fa14q" id="fa14q" href="#ft14q"><span class="sp">14</span></a> The former regulates marriages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page757" id="page757"></a>757</span>
within the Church of England, but was intended to be of universal
application, Jews and Quakers only being excepted by section 31.
It requires either the previous publication of banns, or a licence
from the proper ecclesiastical authority. As to banns, the rule of
the rubric, so far as not altered by the statute, is required to be
observed. They must be published on three successive Sundays
at morning service after the second lesson, in the church of the parish
in which the parties dwell; the bishop may, however, authorize the
publication of banns in a public chapel. Seven days&rsquo; notice must
be given to the clergyman of the names of the parties, their place
of abode, and the time during which they have lived there. If
either party is under age, the dissent of the parents or guardians
expressed at the time of publication of banns renders such publication
null and void. Licence in lieu of banns may only be granted by the
archbishop, bishop or other authority, for the solemnization of a
marriage within the church of the parish in which one of the parties
shall have resided for fifteen days before. Before a licence can be
granted an oath must be taken as to the fact of residence and that
the necessary consent has been obtained in the case of persons under
age. The father, or lawful guardian, is the proper person to consent
to the marriage of a minor, and the place of any such person incapacitated
mentally is taken by the lord chancellor. The absence of
such consent does not, however, avoid a marriage once solemnized.
But if persons wilfully intermarry (unless by special licence) in a
place not being a church or public chapel, or without due publication
of banns or proper licence, or before a person not in holy orders,
the marriage is null and void to all purposes. Marriage must be
celebrated within three months after banns or licence, and between
the hours of eight in the morning and three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>For the relief of the great body of Dissenters the act of 1836 was
passed. It permits marriage to be solemnized in two additional
ways&mdash;viz. (1) by certificate of the superintendent registrar of a
district without licence, and (2) by such certificate with licence.
In the first case, notice must be given to the registrar of the district
or districts within which the parties have resided for seven days
previous, which notice is inscribed in a marriage-notice book, open
to public inspection at all reasonable times, and thereafter suspended
for twenty-one days in some conspicuous place in the registrar&rsquo;s
office. Any person whose consent is necessary to an ecclesiastical
licence may forbid the issue of a certificate, but in default of such
prohibition the certificate will issue at the end of the twenty-one
days. The marriage may then take place on any day within three
months of the entry of notice, and in one of the following ways:
(1) in a certified place of religious worship, registered for the solemnization
of marriage; in that case a registrar of the district with two
witnesses must be present, and the ceremony must include a mutual
declaration of assent by the parties and a disavowal of any impediment;
(2) at the superintendent registrar&rsquo;s office, with the same
declaration, but with no religious service; (3) in a church according
to the usual form, the consent of the minister thereof having been
previously obtained; (4) according to the usages of Jews and Quakers.
The place of marriage in all cases must have been specified in the
notice and certificate.</p>

<p>In the second case, when it is desired to proceed by licence, notice
must be given to the registrar of the district in which one of the
persons resides, together with a declaration that he or she has resided
for fifteen days therein, that there is no impediment, and that the
necessary consents if any have been obtained. The notice is not
exhibited in the registrar&rsquo;s office, and the certificate may be obtained
at the expiration of one whole day after entry, together with the
licence. No registrar&rsquo;s licence can be granted for a marriage in
church or according to the forms of the Church of England&mdash;the
ecclesiastical authorities retaining their jurisdiction in that respect.
It is also provided that in the case of persons wilfully intermarrying
in a place other than that mentioned in the notice and certificate,
or without notice or certificate, &amp;c., the marriage shall be null and
void.</p>

<p>The various rules as to consent of parents, &amp;c., to the marriages
of minors are regulations of procedure only. The absence of the
necessary consent is not a disability invalidating a marriage actually
solemnized.</p>

<p>The Act 26 Geo. II. c. 33, commonly known as Lord Hardwicke&rsquo;s
Act, which forbids the solemnization of marriage without banns or
licence, also enacts that &ldquo;in no case whatsoever shall any suit or
proceeding be had in any ecclesiastical court in order to compel a
celebration <i>in facie ecclesiae</i>, by reason of any contract of matrimony
whatsoever whether <i>per verba de presenti</i> or <i>per verba de futuro</i>.&rdquo;
Blackstone observes that previous to this act &ldquo;any contract made
<i>per verba de presenti</i>, or in words of the present tense, and in case of
cohabitation <i>per verba de futuro</i> also, was deemed valid marriage to
many purposes; and the parties might be compelled in the spiritual
courts to celebrate it <i>in facie ecclesiae</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Royal marriages in England have been subject to special laws.
The Royal Marriage Act of 1772 (12 Geo. III. c. 11), passed in consequence
of the marriages of the dukes of Cumberland and Gloucester,
enacted that &ldquo;no descendant of his late majesty George II. (other
than the issue of princesses married or who may marry into foreign
families) shall be capable of contracting matrimony without the
previous consent of his majesty, his heirs and successors, signified
under the Great Seal. But in case any descendant of George II.,
being above twenty-five years old, shall persist to contract a marriage
disapproved of by his majesty, such descendant, after giving twelve
months&rsquo; notice to the privy council, may contract such marriage,
and the same may be duly solemnized without the consent of his
majesty, &amp;c., and shall be good except both Houses of Parliament
shall declare their disapprobation thereto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1886 an act was passed in the British parliament to remove
doubts which had been entertained as to the validity of certain
marriages solemnized in England when one of the parties was
resident in Scotland. The Summary Jurisdiction (Married Women)
Act of 1895 enabled a wife whose husband is convicted of an assault
on her, or who has been deserted by him, or been obliged owing to
his cruelty to live apart from him, to apply to the justices, who are
empowered by the act to make an order for separation and for
payment by the husband to his wife of such weekly sum, not exceeding
two pounds, as they may consider reasonable. The Marriage
Act 1898 authorized the celebration of marriages in places of
worship duly registered for the solemnization of marriages under
the Marriage Act of 1836 without the presence of the registrar, on
condition of their being solemnized in the presence of a person duly
authorized by the governing body of the place of worship in question.
It also made further provision for the due recording of all marriages
in the general registers. The Marriages Validity Act of 1899
removed doubts as to the validity of marriages in England on Irish
banns and in Ireland on English banns. Lastly, the Marriage
with Foreigners Act 1906 enabled a British subject desirous of
marrying a foreigner in a foreign country to comply with the foreign
law by obtaining from a registrar a certificate that no legal impediment
to the marriage has been shown. Similar certificates, by
arrangement between His Majesty and foreign countries, are issued
in the case of a foreigner desirous of marrying a British subject in
the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The Foreign Marriage Act 1892 has consolidated the English
law relating to marriages celebrated abroad, and brings it into harmony
with the current tendencies of marriage law reform generally.
Under it a marriage between British subjects abroad is as valid as
a marriage duly solemnized in England (as heretofore), if celebrated
in accordance with the local law or in the presence of diplomatic
or consular agents who are appointed to act as &ldquo;marriage officers.&rdquo;
The old fiction of assimilation of a British embassy to British soil
can no longer be relied upon to uphold a marriage at a British
embassy solemnized by an ordained clergyman. An order in
council of the 28th of October 1892, moreover, provides that in the
case of any marriage under the act, if it appears to the marriage
officer that the woman about to be married is a British subject, and
that the man is an alien, he must be satisfied that the marriage will
be recognized by the law of the foreign country to which the alien
belongs.</p>

<p>A marriage may be solemnized on board one of His Majesty&rsquo;s
ships at a foreign station, provided a warrant of a secretary of
state has authorized the commanding officer to be a marriage officer.
At sea, marriages on British public or private ships seem still valid
at common law, if performed by an episcopally ordained minister.
The Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (sect. 240) provides that the
master of a ship for which an official log is required shall enter in
it every marriage taking place on board, with the names and ages
of the parties.</p>

<p>Again, under the Foreign Marriage Act all marriages solemnized
within the British lines by a chaplain or officer or other person
officiating under the orders of the commanding officer of a British
army serving abroad, are as valid in law as if they had been solemnized
within the United Kingdom subject to due observance of all
forms required by law. The Naval Marriages Act 1908 authorizes,
for the purpose of marriages in the United Kingdom, the publication
of banns and the issue of certificates on board His Majesty&rsquo;s
ships in certain cases, or when one of the parties to a marriage
intended to be solemnized in the United Kingdom is an officer,
seaman or marine, borne on the books of one of His Majesty&rsquo;s ships
at sea.</p>

<p>The principle of the English law of marriage, that a marriage
contracted abroad is valid if it has been solemnized according to
the <i>lex loci</i>, may be now taken to apply just as much to a marriage
in a heathen as in a Christian country. Whether the marriage
has or has not been celebrated according to Christian laws has no
bearing upon the question, providing it is a monogamous marriage&mdash;a
marriage which prevents the man who enters into it from
marrying any other woman while his wife continues alive.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Scotland.</i>&mdash;The chief point of distinction, as compared with
English law, is the recognition of irregular marriages. (1) &ldquo;A
public or regular marriage,&rdquo; says Fraser, &ldquo;is one celebrated,
after due proclamation of banns, by a minister of religion;
and it may be celebrated either in a church or in a private house,
and on any day of the week at any hour of the day.&rdquo; The
ministers of the National Church at first alone could perform the
ceremony; but the privilege was extended to Episcopalians by
10 Anne c. 7 (1711), and to other ministers by 4 and 5 Will. IV.
c. 28 (1834). (2) A marriage may also &ldquo;be constituted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page758" id="page758"></a>758</span>
declarations made by the man and the woman that they <i>presently</i>
do take each other for husband and wife.&rdquo; These declarations
&ldquo;may be emitted on any day at any time and without the
presence of witnesses,&rdquo; and either by writing or orally or by
signs, and in any form which is clearly expressive of intention.
Such a marriage is as effectual to all intents and purposes as a
public marriage. The children of it would be legitimate; and
the parties to it would have all the rights in the property of
each other, given by the law of Scotland to husband and wife.
(3) A promise followed by <i>copula</i> does not constitute marriage,
unless followed either by solemnization <i>in facie ecclesiae</i> or
declarator. Lord Moncreiff&rsquo;s opinion in the case of <i>Brown</i> v.
<i>Burns</i> is admitted to be good law, viz. that declarator is essential
to the constitution of a marriage of this kind, so that, if no such
declarator be brought in the lifetime of both parties, the marriage
can never be established afterwards. The <i>copula</i> is presumed
to have reference to the promise, but evidence may be adduced
to show that such was not the case.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>By the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1856 it is enacted that no
<i>irregular</i> marriage shall be valid in Scotland, unless one of the
parties has lived in Scotland for the twenty-one days next preceding
the marriage, or has his or her usual residence there at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Habit and repute&rdquo; has sometimes been spoken of as constituting
marriage in the law of Scotland, but it is more correctly described as
evidence from which marriage may be inferred. The repute must be
the general, constant, and unvarying belief of friends and neighbours,
not merely the controverted opinion of a section of them. The
cohabitation must be in Scotland, but in one case proof of cohabitation
in another country was allowed, as tending to throw light on
the nature of the cohabitation in Scotland.</p>

<p>The consent of parents is not necessary to the validity of the
marriage, even of minors, but marriage under the age of puberty
with or without such consent is void.</p>
</div>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;The absence of ecclesiastical courts has suggested
difficulties as to the extent to which the law of England
on this subject continued to prevail after the revolution. Bishop
holds it to be the universal fact running through all the cases
that everywhere in the country the English decisions on marriage
and divorce are referred to with the same apparent deference
which is shown on other subjects to the decisions of the English
common law and equity tribunals. The same author observes
that &ldquo;all our marriage and divorce laws, and of course all our
statutes on the subject, in so far as they pertain to localities
embraced within the limits of particular states, are state laws
and state statutes, the national power with us not having legislative
or judicial cognisance of the matter within those localities.&rdquo;
Some of the states have extended the ages below which marriage
cannot take place. The common law of the states is assumed
to be that &ldquo;a contract <i>per verba de presenti</i>, or <i>per verba de futuro
cum copula</i>, constitutes a complete marriage.&rdquo; Conditions,
however, may be imposed by the various state legislatures, and
as to these the rule has established itself in American jurisprudence
that &ldquo;a marriage good at common law is good notwithstanding
the existence of any statute on the subject, unless
the statute contains express words of nullity.&rdquo; Thus in Pennsylvania,
where a statute provided that all marriages &ldquo;should be
solemnized before twelve witnesses,&rdquo; marriages not so celebrated
were nevertheless held to be good. In New Hampshire justices
and ministers of the gospel are authorized to solemnize marriage,
and all other persons are forbidden to do so under penalties;
yet a marriage by consent, as at common law, without justice
or minister, has been held valid. On the other hand, under
a very similar statute in Massachusetts, it was held that &ldquo;parties
could not solemnize their own marriage,&rdquo; and that a marriage
by mutual agreement, not in accordance with the statute, was
void. Bishop regards this as an isolated exception to the
general course of the decisions. So when state legislation
requires any particular form to be used the want thereof only
invalidates the act if the statute expressly so enacts. Many
of the state codes inflict penalties on ministers or justices for
celebrating the marriage of minors without the consent of the
parents or guardians. The original law as to prohibited degrees
has been considerably modified in the states. The prohibition
of marriage with a deceased wife&rsquo;s sister has been abolished in
the United States. But New Hampshire, Ohio, Indiana, Kansas,
Arkansas, Nevada, Washington, the Dakotas and Montana have
for long forbidden marriages between first cousins by blood, and
Louisiana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nebraska, Utah and
Wisconsin have since adopted the same principle. Virginia
prohibits the marriage of a woman with the husband of her
brother&rsquo;s or sister&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Attention is also being paid to the question of marriage from a
physical point of view. New Jersey prohibits the marriage of any
person who has been confined in any public asylum as an epileptic,
insane or feeble-minded patient, without a medical certificate
from two physicians of complete recovery, and that there is no
probability of the transmission of such defects. This prohibits
the granting of a marriage licence where either party is an habitual
drunkard, epileptic, imbecile or insane, or where the applicant at
the time of making application is under the influence of any intoxicant
or narcotic drug. In Michigan, Minnesota, Kansas and
Oregon, marriage is prohibited to epileptics, &amp;c., except when the
woman is over forty-five. In Michigan, also, marriage is forbidden
to anyone who has suffered from a venereal disease and has not
been cured. The equality of property rights between husband
and wife is fully established in America. Indeed, in many states
the movement has gone so far as to give the wife in matters of
property and in reference to divorce greater privileges than the
husband. Thus a husband is often liable for a wife&rsquo;s debts where
a wife would not be, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, for a husband&rsquo;s; and a wife
may usually obtain a decree of divorce for any ground on which
one may be awarded to the husband, and, in addition, for neglect
to provide sustenance or support. Emphasis on the personal or
moral relation of the parties in marriage tends to throw into the
background the legal aspects and requirements; and it tends also
to minimize, so far as the state is concerned, the religious and
sacramental aspect of marriage. Marriage tends to become a
relation established by parties between themselves, and one in
which the consent of the parties becomes the only constitutive
element. In the theory of American law no ceremony is essential
to create the marriage relation. But this position has never been
endorsed by any considerable proportion of the community, and
in fact probably <span class="spp">9</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>ths and perhaps <span class="spp">99</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span>ths of the marriages in the
United States are contracted through some ceremony.</p>
</div>

<p><i>France.</i>&mdash;Articles 144-226 of the Code Napoléon, as amended
by an act of 1907, prescribe the qualifications and conditions
of marriage. The man must be eighteen and the woman fifteen
years of age. A son and daughter under twenty-one cannot
marry without consent of the father and mother, or of the father
only if they disagree, or of the survivor if one be dead. If
both are dead grandfather and grandmother take their place.
Between the ages of twenty-one and thirty the parties must still
obtain the consent of their parents, but if this be refused it
can be regulated by means of a &ldquo;respectful and formal act&rdquo;
before a notary. If the consent is not given within thirty days
the marriage may take place without it. If neither parents nor
grandparents be alive, parties under twenty-one require the
consent of the family council. These rules apply to natural
children when affiliated; those not affiliated require the consent
of a specially appointed guardian. Marriage is prohibited
between all ascendants and descendants in the direct line, and
between persons related by marriage in the same line, between
brother and sister, between uncle and niece, and brother-in-law
and sister-in-law.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Before the solemnization of marriage banns are required to be
published for a period of ten days, which must include two Sundays,
containing the names, occupations, and domiciles of the parties and
their parents. There must be an interval of three days before the
marriage can take place, and if a year is allowed to elapse fresh
banns must be put up. On the day appointed by the parties, and
in the parish to which one of them belongs, the marriage is celebrated
by the civil officer or registrar reading over to them the
various necessary documents, with the chapter of the code relating
to husband and wife, receiving from each a declaration that they
take each other for husband and wife, and drawing up the act of
marriage. All this has to be done in the presence of four witnesses.</p>

<p>Marriages contracted abroad between French subjects or between
French subjects and foreigners are valid in France if celebrated
according to the forms of the foreign law, provided the French
conditions as to consent of parents have been observed. (See also
Marriage with Foreigners Act, <i>supra</i>.)</p>
</div>

<p><i>Germany.</i>&mdash;The code of 1900 lays down rules applicable to
the celebration of all marriages within the German Empire.
Civil marriage alone is recognized by the code. It is effected
by the declaration of the parties before a registrar in the presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page759" id="page759"></a>759</span>
of each other of their intention to be married. Two witnesses
of full age must be present. The registrar asks each of the
parties whether he or she will many the other, and on their
answer in the affirmative declares them duly married and enters
the marriage in the register. The marriage must be preceded
by a public notice. Marriages are void between descendants and
ascendants; relatives by marriage in the ascending or descending
line; brother and sister of the whole or half blood.</p>

<p><i>Other Countries.</i>&mdash;In the great majority of the other European
countries civil marriage is obligatory. In Roman Catholic
countries the parties usually supplement the obligatory civil
marriage by a religious ceremony, more especially since the
papal decree <i>Ne temere</i> of the 2nd of August 1907 (which came
into force at Easter 1908), which requires marriages between
Roman Catholics, or between Roman Catholics and those not
professing that faith, to be celebrated before a bishop or priest
duly authorized for the celebration thereof.</p>

<p><a name="ft1q" id="ft1q" href="#fa1q"><span class="fn">1</span></a> It is doubtless true, as anthropologists have pointed out, that in
the history of the race &ldquo;marriage is rooted in the family rather
than the family in marriage&rdquo; (<span class="sc">Westermarck</span>: <i>History of Human
Marriage</i>, p. 22); but in that conscious experience of the individual
with which law and ethics are especially concerned, this relationship

quam consanguineus habuit ... duceret uxorem ... incestos
esse non dubitamus (Mansi <i>Conc.</i> viii. p. 336). According to
the canon law &ldquo;affinity&rdquo; is the relation between two persons of
whom one has had commerce, licit or illicit, with a relation of the
other.</p>

<p><a name="ft4q" id="ft4q" href="#fa4q"><span class="fn">4</span></a> The civil law counts, in the direct line, as many degrees as
there are generations between the parties; <i>e.g.</i> the son is in regard
to his father in the 1st degree, the grandson in the 2nd, and vice
versa. In the collateral line it computes degrees by generations,
<i>i.e.</i> from one of the relations to the common ancestor, without
including him or her, and from him or her back to the other relation;
<i>e.g.</i> two brothers are in the 2nd degree of relationship to one another,
uncle and nephew in the 3rd, cousins-german in the 4th.</p>

<p>The canon law, which in this case derives from the old Germanic
law, has the same computation as regards the direct line. In the
case of collateral relations, however, it differs, having two rules:
(1) In the case of <i>equal line</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> when the collaterals are equally
removed from the common progenitor, it reckons the same number
of degrees between the collaterals as between one of them and the
progenitor; <i>e.g.</i> brothers are related in the 1st degree, while cousins-german
are related in the 2nd degree because they are two generations
from the common grandfather. (2) In the case of <i>unequal
line</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> when the collaterals are unequally removed from the
common ancestor, the degree of their relationship is that of the
most remote from the common progenitor; <i>e.g.</i> uncle and niece are
related in the 2nd degree&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> that of the niece to the grandfather.</p>

<p>The civil computation was furiously attacked by canonists as
tending to laxity (see Peter Damianus, &ldquo;De parentelae gradibus,&rdquo;
in Migne, <i>Patrol. Lat.</i> cxlv. 191, &amp;c.).</p>

<p><a name="ft5q" id="ft5q" href="#fa5q"><span class="fn">5</span></a> Innocent III. also decided that the husband&rsquo;s relations were
not related to those of the wife, and vice versa, thus establishing
the rule that &ldquo;affinity does not breed affinity&rdquo; (<i>affinitas non parit
affinitatem</i>).</p>

<p><a name="ft6q" id="ft6q" href="#fa6q"><span class="fn">6</span></a> This is fixed by the canon law at 14 for a male, 12 for a female.
If, however, owing to the precocious physical development of a
girl, the marriage has been consummated before she has reached this
age, it cannot be nullified.</p>

<p><a name="ft7q" id="ft7q" href="#fa7q"><span class="fn">7</span></a> It is maintained that no pope has ever given a dispensation for
such a marriage. Such a case seems, however, to be narrated by
Ordericus Vitalis (<i>Hist. eccles.</i> viii. 23; ed. A. le Prévost, Paris,
1838-1855, t. iii. p. 408; ed. A. Duchesne, 1619, 704 B). Robert
Mowbray, earl of Northumberland, had only been married to Maud
de Laigle three months when he was condemned to perpetual
imprisonment for rebellion against King William Rufus. After
describing her forlorn state Orderic continues: &ldquo;Nec ipsa eo vivente,
secundum legem Dei, alteri nubere legitime valebat. Tandum,
permissu Paschalis Papae (II.), cui res, a curiosis enucleata, patuit,
post multos dies Nigellus de Albineo ipsam uxorem accepit.&rdquo; This
may mean no more, of course, than that the curiosi &ldquo;untied the
knot&rdquo; by discovering an impediment&mdash;the usual expedient in such
cases. In any case the fact that Nigel de Albini, in his turn,
soon afterwards obtained a &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; from her on the ground
that her first husband was his relative by consanguinity, hardly
points to a strict view of the sanctity of the marriage tie.</p>

<p><a name="ft8q" id="ft8q" href="#fa8q"><span class="fn">8</span></a> The customary rule for more than three centuries after the
Council of Trent was that male children followed the religion of
the father, female children that of the mother. On the general
subject of the attitude of the Church towards mixed marriages
see O. D. Watkins, <i>Holy Matrimony</i>, pp. 468 et seq. For the Roman
Catholic view see &ldquo;An Instruction on Mixed Marriages&rdquo; in Bishop

of 1864 is lxvi.: &ldquo;Matrimonii sacramentum non est, nisi quid
contractui accessorium ab eoque separabile, ipsumque sacramentum
in una tantum nuptiali benedictione situm est.&rdquo; This condemns
the attempts of certain canonists (<i>e.g.</i> Melchior Cano) to distinguish
between the <i>contractus naturalis</i> and <i>sacramentalis</i>. This view,
which was first advanced by the jurist and theologian Johann
Gropper (1502-1559) at the council of Cologne (1536), and gained
support especially in France, makes the &ldquo;matter&rdquo; of the sacrament
the consent of the parties, the &ldquo;form&rdquo; the prayers and benedictions,
the &ldquo;minister&rdquo; the priests (see <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;Du sacrament de mariage&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">MARRUCINI,<a name="ar206" id="ar206"></a></span> an ancient tribe which occupied a small strip
of territory round about Teate (mod. Chieti), on the east coast
of Italy. It is first mentioned in history as a member of a
confederacy with which the Romans came into conflict in the
second Samnite War, 325 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and it entered the Roman Alliance
as a separate unit at the end of that war (see further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paeligni</a></span>).
We know something of the language of the Marrucini from an
inscription known as the &ldquo;Bronze of Rapino,&rdquo; which belongs to
about the middle of the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> It is written in Latin
alphabet, but in a dialect which belongs to the North Oscan
group (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paeligni</a></span>). The name of the city or tribe which it
gives us is <i>touta marouca</i>, and it mentions also a citadel with
the epithet <i>tarincris</i>. Several of its linguistic features, both in
vocabulary and in syntax, are of considerable interest to the
student of Latin or Italic grammar (<i>e.g.</i> the use of the subjunctive,
without any conjunction, to express purpose, a clause
prescribing a sacrifice to Ceres being followed immediately by
<i>pacr si ut propitia sit</i>). The earliest Latin inscriptions are of
Ciceronian date.</p>

<p>The form of the name is of considerable interest, as it shows
the suffix -NO- superimposed upon the suffix -CO-, a change
which probably indicates some conquest of an earlier tribe by
the invading Safini (or Sabini, <i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARRYAT, FREDERICK<a name="ar208" id="ar208"></a></span> (1792-1848), English sailor and
novelist, was born at Westminster on the 10th of July 1792. He
was the grandson of Thomas Marryat (physician, author of <i>The
Philosophy of Masons</i>, and writer of verse), and son of Joseph
Marryat, agent for the island of Grenada, who wrote pamphlets
in defence of the Slave Trade. His mother was a Bostonian
of German extraction. Young Marryat distinguished himself as
a boy by frequently running away to go to sea; and at last,
at the age of fourteen, he was allowed to enter the navy. His
first service was under Lord Cochrane (afterwards tenth earl of
Dundonald) in the famous &ldquo;Impérieuse,&rdquo; and no midshipman
ever had a livelier apprenticeship to the sea. During his two
and a half years of service under Cochrane, the young midshipman
witnessed more than fifty engagements, and had much
experience of service on the coast of Spain in the early stage
of the Peninsular War, in the attack on the French squadron in
the Roads (April 1809) and in the Walcheren expedition. Before
the general peace of 1815 he had served in North America and
the West Indies and gained a wide knowledge of conditions of
life on board ship under various commanders. In 1815 he was
promoted to the rank of commander. After holding various
commands he commissioned the &ldquo;Larne,&rdquo; 20, for the East Indies
and was senior naval officer at Rangoon during the Burmese
War from May to September 1824. In the early part of the
next year he commanded an expedition up the Bassein River,
in which Bassein was occupied and the Burmese stores seized.
His services were acknowledged by a nomination as C.B. in 1826.
He frequently received honourable mention for his behaviour
in action, and in 1818 he received the medal of the Humane
Society for &ldquo;at least a dozen&rdquo; gallant rescues. Marryat&rsquo;s
honours were not confined to gallant exploits. He adapted
Sir Home Popham&rsquo;s code of signals to a code for the Mercantile
Marine, for which he was made F.R.S. in 1819, and received
the Legion of Honour from Louis Philippe in 1833. A pamphlet
written to propose a substitute for the system of impressment
in 1822 is said to have offended King William IV.</p>

<p>Marryat brought ripe experience and unimpaired vivacity to
his work when he began to write novels. <i>Frank Mildmay,
or the Naval Officer</i>, was published in 1829, and <i>The King&rsquo;s Own</i>
followed in 1830. The novels of the sea captain at once won
public favour. The freshness of the new field which was opened
up to the imagination&mdash;so full of vivid lights and shadows,
light-hearted fun, grinding hardship, stirring adventure, heroic
action, warm friendships, bitter hatreds&mdash;was in exhilarating
contrast to the world of the historical romancer and the fashionable
novelist, to which the mind of the general reader was at
that date given over. He had an admirable gift of lucid, direct
narrative, and an unfailing fund of incident, and of humour,
sometimes bordering on farce. Of all his portraits of adventurous
sailors, &ldquo;Gentleman Chucks&rdquo; in <i>Peter Simple</i> and
&ldquo;Equality Jack&rdquo; in <i>Mr Midshipman Easy</i> are the most famous,
but he created many other types which take rank among the
characteristic figures in English fiction. Marryat&rsquo;s first attempt
was somewhat severely criticized from an artistic point of view,
and he was accused of gratifying private grudges by introducing
real personages too thinly disguised; and as he attributed some
of his own adventures to Frank Mildmay he was rather shocked
to learn that readers identified him with that disagreeable
character. <i>The King&rsquo;s Own</i> was a vast improvement, in point
of construction, upon <i>Frank Mildmay</i>; and he went on, through
a quick succession of tales, <i>Newton Forster</i> (1832), <i>Peter Simple</i>
(1834), <i>Jacob Faithful</i> (1834), <i>The Pacha of Many Tales</i> (1835),
<i>Japhet in Search of a Father</i> (1836), <i>Mr Midshipman Easy</i> (1836),
<i>The Pirate and the Three Cutters</i> (1836), till he reached his high-water
mark of constructive skill in <i>Snarley-yow, or the Dog Fiend</i>
(1837). The best of his books after this date are those written
expressly for boys, the favourites being <i>Masterman Ready</i> (1841),
<i>The Settlers in Canada</i> (1844), and <i>The Children of the New Forest
</i>(1847). Among his other works are <i>The Phantom Ship</i> (1839);
<i>A Diary in America</i> (1839); <i>Olla Podrida</i> (1840), a collection of
miscellaneous papers; <i>Poor Jack</i> (1840); <i>Joseph Rushbrook</i> (1841);
<i>Percival Keene</i> (1842); <i>Monsieur Violet</i> (1842); <i>The Privateer&rsquo;s</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page760" id="page760"></a>760</span>
<i>Man</i> (1844); <i>The Mission, or Scenes in Africa</i> (1845); <i>The Little
Savage</i> (1848-1849), published posthumously; and <i>Valerie</i>, not
completed (1849). His novels form an important link between
Smollett and Fielding and Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>Captain Marryat had retired from the naval service in 1830,
becoming equerry to the duke of Sussex. He edited the <i>Metropolitan
Magazine</i> from 1832 to 1835, and some of his best stories
appeared in that paper. He spent a great part of his time in
Brussels, where he was very popular. He visited Canada during
Papineau&rsquo;s revolt and the United States in 1837, and gave a
disparaging account of American institutions in a <i>Diary</i> published
on his return to England. While at New York he wrote a play,
<i>The Ocean Waif, or Channel Outlaw</i>, which was acted, and
is forgotten. His versatility is further shown by the fact that
he drew rough caricatures and other sketches with some spirit.
Some capital snatches of verse are scattered throughout his
novels, the best being &ldquo;Poll put her arms akimbo&rdquo; in <i>Snarley-yow</i>,
and the &ldquo;Hunter and the Maid&rdquo; in <i>Poor Jack</i>. In 1843
he settled at Langham Manor, Norfolk. He indulged in costly
experiments in farming, so that in spite of the large income
earned by his books he was not a rich man. He died at Langham
on the 9th of August 1848, his death being hastened by news
of the loss of his son by shipwreck.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARS, MLLE [ANNE FRANÇOISE HYPPOLYTE BOUTET]<a name="ar209" id="ar209"></a></span>
(1779-1847), French actress, was born in Paris on the 9th of
February 1779, the natural daughter of the actor-author
named Monvel [Jacques Marie Boutet, 1745-1812], and Mlle
Mars Salvetat, an actress whose southern accent had made
her Paris <i>début</i> a failure. Mlle Mars began her stage career
in children&rsquo;s parts, and by 1799, after the rehabilitation of
the Comédie Française, she and her sister (Mars <i>aînée</i>) joined
that company, of which she remained an active member for
thirty-three years. Her beauty and talents soon placed her
at the top of her profession. She was incomparable in <i>ingénue</i>
parts, and equally charming as the coquette. Molière, Marivaux,
Sedaine, and Beaumarchais had no more accomplished
interpreter, and in her career of half a century, besides many
comedy rôles of the older <i>répertoire</i>, she created fully a hundred
parts in plays which owed success largely to her. For her
farewell performance she selected Elmire in <i>Tartuffe</i>, and
Silvia in <i>Jeu de l&rsquo;amour et du hasard</i>, two of her most popular
rôles; and for her benefit, a few days after, Célimène in <i>Le Misanthrope</i>
and Araminthe in <i>Les Femmes savantes</i>. She retired
in 1841, and died in Paris on the 20th of March 1847.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MARS<a name="ar210" id="ar210"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Mavors</span>, <span class="sc">Marmar</span>, <span class="sc">Marspiter or Maspiter</span>), after
Jupiter the most important deity of the Roman state, and
one who, unlike most Roman deities, was never so much affected
by foreign influences as to lose his essentially Roman and
Italian character. Traces of his worship are found in all parts
of central and southern Italy, in Umbria, Picenum, Samnium,
and in one or two Etruscan cities, as well as in Latium; and
in several communities, as we learn from Ovid (<i>Fasti</i>, 3.93 seq.),
he gave his name to a month, as at Rome to the first month
of the old Roman year. We know little of the character of
his cult except at Rome, and even at Rome it has been variously
interpreted. He has been explained as a sun-god, a god of
wind and storm, a god of the year and a god of vegetation;
and he has been compared with Apollo by Roscher (<i>Apollo,
and Mars</i>, 1873, and in the article &ldquo;Mars&rdquo; in his <i>Lexicon of
Mythology</i>). But in historical times his chief function at Rome
was to protect the state in war, and it is as a god of war that he
is known to all readers of Roman literature. So entirely did
this characteristic get the better of all others, that his name
came to be used as a synonym for <i>bellum</i>; and in the latest
and most careful of all accounts of the Roman religion he is
pronounced to have been from first to last a god of war only
(see Wissowa, <i>Religion und Kultus der Römer</i>, p. 129 seq.).</p>

<p>Until the time of Augustus Mars had but two temples at
Rome, and both are connected with warlike operations. One of
these was originally only an altar; it was in the Campus Martius,
the exercising-ground of the army. The other was outside
the Porta Capena, the gate through which the army marched
on its way to campaigns to the south: here too each year the
Equites met in order to start in procession through the city
(<i>Dion. Hal.</i> 6. 13). Each of these sites was outside the <i>pomerium</i>,
and this has been explained to mean that the war-god &ldquo;must
be kept at a distance&rdquo; (Carter, <i>Religion of Numa</i>, p. 19). But
in the heart of the city there was a <i>sacrarium</i> of Mars in the
<i>regia</i>, originally the king&rsquo;s house, in which the sacred spears
of Mars were kept, and the fact that on the outbreak of war
the consul had to shake these spears, saying as he did it, <i>Mars
vigila</i> (&ldquo;Mars, wake up!&rdquo;), shows that the god was believed
to reside here in some spiritual sense. If the spears moved of
themselves, the omen was bad and called for expiation. The
<i>ancilia</i>, or sacred shields, also formed part of this symbolic
armoury of the Roman state: they were carried in procession by
the Salii (<i>q.v.</i>) or dancing warrior-priests of Mars on several occasions
during the month of March up to the 23rd (<i>tubilustrium</i>),
when the military trumpets (<i>tubae</i>) were lustrated: and again
in October to the 19th (<i>armilustrium</i>), when both the <i>ancilia</i>
and the arms of the exercitus were purified and put away for
the winter. During the four months of the Italian winter the
worship of Mars seems at a standstill: we have no trace of
it in the calendar or in Roman literature. His activity is
all in the warm season, <i>i.e.</i> in the season of warfare. It is
only at the end of February that we find indications of the
coming force of the Mars-cult in the month which bears his
name: Quirinus, who was probably the Mars of the community
settled on the Quirinal Hill, and had his twelve Salii corresponding
to those of the Palatine Mars, held his festival on the
17th of February, and on the 27th was the first festival called
Equirria, the second being on the 14th of March. The name
indicates horse-racing; horses were bred and used at Rome
chiefly for military purposes, and it is possible to see here,
as in the Equirria of the 14th of March, which we know was a
festival of Mars (W. W. Fowler, <i>Roman Festivals</i>, p. 44), an
exercise of the war-horses, accompanied with sacrifice to Mars,
preparatory to the opening of the season of arms.</p>

<p>There is thus abundant evidence, based on the ancient calendars
and the features of the cult, that Mars was all along a
deity especially connected with warfare; and it is hardly necessary
to add proof of a less convincing kind, <i>e.g.</i> that the wolf,
his special animal, is a warlike beast, or that Nerio, a female
deity who may anciently have been coupled with him, seems
to be etymologically &ldquo;the strong one,&rdquo; or that he is in legend
the father of Romulus the warlike king and founder of the
Roman army, as compared with Numa, who instituted the
Roman law and religion. Enough has been said to show why
Mars should have become exclusively a god of war, even if
the Roman state in its advance in the conquest of other peoples
had not given a continual impulse to this aspect of the cult.
In founding his famous temple of Mars Ultor (the avenger
of Caesar) in the Forum Augusti, Augustus gave a new
turn to this worship, and for a time it seems to have been a
rival of that of the Capitoline Jupiter (see Carter, <i>Religion
of Numa</i>, p. 174 seq.), and late in the period of the empire
Mars became the most prominent of the <i>di militares</i> worshipped
by the Roman legions.</p>

<p>There are however certain features in the Mars cult which
make it probable that this god was not entirely warlike in
character. He seems, in early times, at least, to have been
also associated with agriculture; and this is in harmony with
the facts: (1) that the season of arms is also the season of the
growth, ripening and harvesting of the crops; (2) that the early
Roman community was an agricultural as well as a military
one, as is indicated in its religious calendar (Fowler, <i>Roman
Festivals</i>, p. 334). Thus Mars was invoked in the ancient hymn
of the Arval Brothers, whose religious duties had as their object
to keep off enemies of all kinds from crops and herds (Henzen,
<i>Acta Fratr. Arv.</i> p. 26, 1874; Wordsworth, <i>Fragments</i> and
<i>Specimens of Early Latin</i>, p. 385 seq.); and his association here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page761" id="page761"></a>761</span>
with the Lares (<i>q.v.</i>) proves that he is not regarded as a war-god
who could avert the raid of an enemy. Still more striking
is the invocation of Mars (with the cult-title Silvanus) in the
yearly lustration of his land by the Roman farmer (Cato, <i>De
re rustica</i>, 141), where it is not a human enemy, but disease,
and all unwholesome influences, which the god is besought to
avert from the farm and land, plantations and flocks. Three
times the procession went round the land, reciting prayers
and driving the victims to be sacrificed, viz. ox, sheep and
pig (<i>suovetaurilia</i>), representing the farmer&rsquo;s most valuable
stock. We can hardly doubt that in the state ceremony of
the Ambarvalia, <i>i.e.</i> the <i>lustratio</i> of the ager romanus in its
earliest form, the same god was invoked and the same ritual
used (Fowler, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 124 seq.). Again in the curious ritual
of the sacrifice to Mars of the October horse (Oct. 15: Fowler
<i>op. cit.</i> 241), though the animal was undoubtedly a war-horse,
the head was cut off and decked with cakes, as we are told
(Paul. Diac. 220) <i>ob frugum eventum</i>. Even Quirinus, the
form of Mars worshipped in the Quirinal community, is not
without an association with agricultural perils, for it was his
<i>flamen</i> who sacrificed the victims at the Robigalia on the 25th
of April, when the spirit of the mildew (robigus) was invoked
to spare the corn (Ovid, <i>Fasti</i>, 4. 901 seq.).</p>

<p>War and agriculture are thus the two factors of human life
and experience which are unquestionably prominent in the
cult of Mars, and explain his importance in a community like
that of Rome: and there is no need, in a short account of this
religious conception, to determine whether he was by origin
a solar deity, a storm-god, or a vegetation-spirit. His name
gives us no help, its etymology is uncertain (Roscher in <i>Mythological
Lexicon</i>, <i>s.v.</i> &ldquo;Mars,&rdquo; p. 2436). But we are safe in conjecturing
that Mars first came into prominence among the
Latins and kindred peoples in the course of their long struggle
for settlements among the mountains and forests of Italy.
The clearing of primeval woodland, the perils of agriculture
from the raids of enemies and of wild beasts, and from the
ravages of disease, are all indicated in the later Mars cult.
The wolf and the woodpecker, denizens of the forest, always
remained his sacred animals, and were believed in Italian
legend to have led the Piceni and Hirpini to their places of
settlement. Mars is specially associated with the early foundation
legends of Italy, as was the case at Rome: and it was to
him that the <i>ver sacrum</i> was dedicated, <i>i.e.</i> the entire produce
of a spring, including the children born then, who were eventually
driven forth from their homes to form new settlements elsewhere
(Roscher in <i>Lex. Myth.</i> 2411). The fierce character of
the god, gained no doubt in this period of struggle and danger,
never entirely left him. Even in the hymn of the Fratres
Arvales he is the &ldquo;fierce Mars&rdquo; (<i>fere Mars</i>), and in the prayer
of Cato&rsquo;s farmer, though he has become &ldquo;Father Mars,&rdquo; he is
Silvanus (<i>q.v.</i>), the dweller in the woodland which surrounded
the agricultural clearing.</p>
